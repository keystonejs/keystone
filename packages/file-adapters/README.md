# File Adapters

The `File` field type can support files hosted in a range of different contexts, e.g. in the local filesystem, or on a cloud based file server.

Different contexts are supported by different file adapters. This package contains the built-in file adapters supported by Keystone.

## `LocalFileAdapter`

## `CloudinaryFileAdapter`
