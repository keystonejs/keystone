# File Adapters

The `File` field type can support files hosted in a range of different contexts, e.g. in the local filesystem, or on a cloud based file server.

Different contexts are supported by different file adapters. This package contains the built-in file adapters supported by KeystoneJS.

## `LocalFileAdapter`

### Usage

```javascript
const fileAdapter = new LocalFileAdapter({
  src: './files',
  path: '/public',
});
```

## `CloudinaryFileAdapter`
