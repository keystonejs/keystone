# Arch-UI Icons

This package contains pre-built React components for the SVG icons we use in the Admin UI.

It currently just has [GitHub's Octicons](https://octicons.github.com) but more may be added in the future.

The files in `./icons` are built from the template in `./build/template.js`.

To rebuild the icons, run `yarn build` and commit your changes.
