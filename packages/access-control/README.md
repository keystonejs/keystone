# Access Control

This package is an internal helper package used by Keystone to parse and validate access control expressions.

You should probably not use this directly in your Keystone projects.

For more information on how to configure access control for you Keystone application, please consult the [Access Control Guide](../../docs/guides/access-control.md).
