# Starter Project - Todo List

This is the todo list - the simplest implementation of Keystone. The todo list allows you to see what the minimum requirements are for running Keystone. It has no fancy extras and only one list - easy peasy!

**[Read the Keystone Docs](https://v5.keystonejs.com)**

## Running the Project.

```
yarn start
```

Then visit:

- The Todo application at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
- The KeystoneJS Admin UI at [`http://localhost:3000/admin`](http://localhost:3000/admin)
- The GraphQL Playground at [`http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql`](http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql)

## React App

The one 'extra' that this project includes is an example React App that consumes the data from Keystone via GraphQl. The app uses React's UMD build and is housed within the `/public` directory. It allows you to see how easy it is to create an app that can use Keystone's GraphQL APIs.
