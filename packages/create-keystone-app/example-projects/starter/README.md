# KeystoneJS Starter Template

You've created a KeystoneJS project! This project contains a simple list of users and an admin application (`localhost:3000/admin`) with basic authentication.

## Running the Project.

To run this project first run `npm install`. Note: If you generated this project via the Keystone cli step this has been done for you \\o/.

Once running, the Keystone Admin UI is reachable via `localhost:3000/admin`.

## Next steps

This example has no front-end application but you can build your own using the GraphQL API (`http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql`).
