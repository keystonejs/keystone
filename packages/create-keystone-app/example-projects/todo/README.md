# KeystoneJS Todo List Template

You've created a KeystoneJS project! This project contains an example of a basic Todo list. Look at the `index.js` file to see how the list is configured. It also contains a StaticApp that provides an example of simple front-end application that makes use of the graphQL API. Take a look at the `public` folder to see how this application is built.

## Running the Project.

To run this project first run `npm install`. Note: If you generated this project via the Keystone cli step this has been done for you \\o/.

Once running, the Keystone Admin UI is reachable via `localhost:3000/admin`.

## Next steps

This example has no authentication, meaning anyone can add or remove todo items. You can lean more about access control and authentication at: `https://keystonejs.com/api/access-control`.
