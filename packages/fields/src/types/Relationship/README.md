# Relationship

A link between the current list and others, often paired with a field on the other list.
The relationships cardinality is determined by the `many` and `isRequired` configuring on either side.

See the [Configuring Relationships](/docs/guides/relationships.md) guide for more information.

## Usage

```javascript
const { Relationship, Text } = require('@keystone-next/fields-legacy');

keystone.createList('User', {
  fields: {
    name: { type: Text },
    posts: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Post', many: true },
    company: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Org' },
  },
});

keystone.createList('Post', {
  fields: {
    title: { type: Text },
  },
});

keystone.createList('Org', {
  fields: {
    name: { type: Text },
  },
});
```

## Config

| Option     | Type      | Default | Description                                                     |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isUnique` | `Boolean` | `false` | Adds a unique index that allows only unique values to be stored |

## Nested mutations

Using the example list config above,
the to-many (`User.posts`) and to-single (`User.company`) relationships can be mutated as part of a mutation on items in the parent list
(eg; during a `createUser`, or `updateUser` mutation, etc).

The available nested mutations:

| Nested Mutation | to-single relationship                                                                                                        | to-many relationship                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create`        | Create a new item, and set it as the relation. <br/>_Note: the previously set item (if any) is **not** deleted._              | Create 1 or more new items, and append them to the list of related items.                                                                                 |
| `connect`       | Filter for an item, and set it as the relation. <br/>_Note: the previously set item (if any) is **not** deleted._             | Filter for one or more items, and append them to the list of related items.                                                                               |
| `disconnect`    | Unset the relation (if any) if it matches the given filter. <br/>_Note: the previously set item (if any) is **not** deleted._ | Filter for one or more items, and unset them from the list of related items (if any). <br/>_Note: the previously set items (if any) are **not** deleted._ |
| `disconnectAll` | Unset the relation (if any). <br/>_Note: the previously set item (if any) is **not** deleted._                                | Unset the list of related items (if any). <br/>_Note: the previously set items (if any) are **not** deleted._                                             |

## Order of execution

Nested mutations are executed in the following order:

1. `disconnectAll`
2. `disconnect`
3. `create`
4. `connect`

## Examples

### Create and append a related item

Use the `create` nested mutation to create and append an item to a to-many
relationship:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```graphql
# Replace all posts of a given User
mutation replaceAllPosts {
  updateUser(
    id: "abc123",
    data: {
      posts: {
        create: { title: "Hello World" },
      }
    }
  ) {
    # Now has a new post appended with the title "Hello World"
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Append an existing item

Use the `connect` nested mutation to append an existing item to a to-many
relationship:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```graphql
# Replace the company of a given User
mutation replaceAllPosts {
  updateUser(
    id: "abc123",
    data: {
      posts: {
        connect: { id: "def345" },
      }
    }
  ) {
    # Now has an existing post appended with the id "def345"
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Overriding a to-single relationship

Using either `create` or `connect` nested mutations is sufficient to override
the value of a to-single relationship (it's not necessary to use `disconnectAll`
as is the case for [to-many relationships](#overriding-a-to-many-relationship)):

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```graphql
# Replace the company of a given User
mutation replaceAllPosts {
  updateUser(
    id: "abc123",
    data: {
      company: {
        connect: { id: "def345" },
      }
    }
  ) {
    # Will now be the company with id "def345"
    company {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Overriding a to-many relationship

To completely replace the related items in a to-many list, you can perform a
`disconnectAll` nested mutation followed by a `create` or `connect` nested
mutation (thanks to the [order of execution](#order-of-execution)):

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```graphql
# Replace all posts related to a given User
mutation replaceAllPosts {
  updateUser(
    id: "abc123",
    data: {
      posts: {
        disconnectAll: true,
        connect: [{ id: "def345" }, { id: "xyz789" }],
      }
    }
  ) {
    # Will now only contain posts with ids "def345" & "xyz789"
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```
