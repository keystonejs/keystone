// not using export * because Rollup's CJS re-export code doesn't ignore __esModule on the exports object so it will re-define it if it exists
// and since __esModule isn't configurable(at least with the code that's _generally_ emitted by Rollup, Babel, tsc and etc.)
// an error will be thrown
// that's normally not a problem because modules generally use Object.defineProperty(exports, '__esModule', { value: true })
// which means that the property isn't enumerable but Next uses Babel's loose mode and Babel's loose mode for the CJS transform
// uses exports.__esModule = true instead of defineProperty so the property is enumerable
