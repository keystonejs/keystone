# WYSIWYG HTML Field powered by TinyMCE Editor

This field inserts a string path into your schema based on the `Text` field type implementation, and renders a WYSIWYG editor in the Admin UI using [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/)

The `Editor` implementation was inspired by the [tinymce-react](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-react) Official TinyMCE React component, Copyright 2017-present Ephox, Inc.
