# @keystone-alpha/adapter-knex

## 1.0.0

- [major] 8b6734ae:

  - This is the first release of keystone-alpha (previously voussoir).
    All packages in the `@voussoir` namespace are now available in the `@keystone-alpha` namespace, starting at version `1.0.0`.
    To upgrade your project you must update any `@voussoir/<foo>` dependencies in `package.json` to point to `@keystone-alpha/<foo>: "^1.0.0"` and update any `require`/`import` statements in your code.

# @voussoir/adapter-knex

## 0.0.3

- [patch] 6fa810f7:

  - Rename `@voussoir/core` -> `@voussoir/keystone`. This is to free up the
    `@voussoir/core` package for a different purpose, and make the main import for
    new Keystone projects be `@voussoir/keystone`. The exports have stayed the
    same.

- [patch] 113e16d4:

  - Remove unused dependencies

## 0.0.2

- [patch] 6471fc4a:

  - Add fieldAdaptersByPath object to field adapters
