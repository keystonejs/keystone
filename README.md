## What's new?

[Keystone 6](http://keystonejs.com) is the new major version of KeystoneJS, the most powerful headless content management system around. We've substantially rewritten the CLI, Schema config, and Admin UI to make them more powerful and easier to use than ever before.

It's currently in the final stages of preview release, and published on npm under the `@keystone-next` namespace. To learn more, check out our [Roadmap page](https://keystonejs.com/updates/roadmap).

## Keystone 5

The [Keystone 5](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-5) codebase is now in maintenance mode and lives at [keystonejs/keystone-5](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-5).

For more information please read our [Keystone 5 and beyond](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-5/issues/21) post.

## Documentation

Keystone 6 is documented on our website: [keystonejs.com/docs](https://keystonejs.com/docs). API Docs are complete, and we're furiously working to expand on our guides and walkthroughs.

Join our [Community Slack](https://community.keystonejs.com/) to get help, share ideas, and explore what's possible in this new release.

## Examples

The [examples](./examples) directory contains a number of complete projects which show how to use Keystone's features.
