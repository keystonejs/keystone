# What's New in Keystone Next

> Note: this page is a working draft, we have more to talk about!

In this major update, we've focused on improving Keystone's **interfaces**, including the way you
configure and run Keystone projects, and a whole new Admin UI.

We're also adding powerful new features to make Keystone the best headless content management system
around, especially when you're using a component-based front-end like React and Vue.

#### ğŸŒŸ Here are some of the highlights:

## Simpler Config with TypeScript

We've massively simplified how you configure a Keystone project, and now have full TypeScript
support so you get autocomplete and validation as you work.

## All New Admin UI

Our Admin UI has been completely rewritten with Next.js behind the scenes and a new Design System.
It's a lot faster, and more customisable than ever before.

Among other improvements, the Keystone Authoring UX is now aware of your application permissions, so
users get the right field interfaces based on whether they can view or edit a field.

## Document Field

You can now set up a visual editor that manages components you have created - with custom props, and
WYSIWYG previews. Perfect for authoring content that works with a Design System on the front-end.

## Extensible GraphQL Schema

Keystone now gives you an executable GraphQL Schema that you can extend with your own custom types,
queries and mutations. It's perfect for adding your own logic into your app, or integrating with
external services through a unified API.

And the best part is, it's the GraphQL Standard, so you can integrate any other project that
produces a GraphQL API with no additional work, and no lock-in!

## Next.js-based Server

Both Keystone's Admin UI and GraphQL API are now generated into a Next.js app. So anywhere you can
host Next.js, you can host Keystone.

## More Flexible Session Management

We've replaced `express-session` with our own Session implementation, which gives you full control
over how user data is stored and initialised for every request.

And it flows straight through into access control, with shortcuts for querying the GraphQL API and
loading exactly the data you need to secure your system.

## Updated Reference Examples

We're building out a comprehensive new set of example projects, so you can see how to easily build
anything from a simple blog to a complete e-Commerce app back-end.

We also have new reference examples for how to use advanced features, like implementing your own
roles-based access control system.
