# Hooks API

Hooks allow you to execute code at different stages of the mutation lifecycle when performing create, update, and delete operations.
Lists and fields both support the same set of hook functions, with some slight differences in the arguments they accept.
The differences will be explicitly called out below.

For examples of how to use hooks in your system please see the [hooks guide](../guides/hooks).

```typescript
import { config, createSchema, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone/schema';
import { text } from '@keystone-next/fields';

export default config({
  lists: createSchema({
    ListName: list({
      hooks: {
        // Hooks for create and update operations
        resolveInput: async args => { /* ... */ },
        validateInput: async args => { /* ... */ },
        beforeChange: async args => { /* ... */ },
        afterChange: async args => { /* ... */ },

        // Hooks for delete operations
        validateDelete: async args => { /* ... */ },
        beforeDelete: async args => { /* ... */ },
        afterDelete: async args => { /* ... */ },
      },
      fields: {
        fieldName: text({
          hooks: {
            // Hooks for create and update operations
            resolveInput: async args => { /* ... */ },
            validateInput: async args => { /* ... */ },
            beforeChange: async args => { /* ... */ },
            afterChange: async args => { /* ... */ },

            // Hooks for delete operations
            validateDelete: async args => { /* ... */ },
            beforeDelete: async args => { /* ... */ },
            afterDelete: async args => { /* ... */ },
          },
        }),
      },
    }),
  }),
});
```

## Update and create hooks

Update and create hooks are called for all `update` and `create` operations.
When updating or creating multiple values the hooks are called individually for each item being updated or created.

### resolveInput

The `resolveInput` function is used to modify or augment the `data` values passed in to a `create` or `update` operation.

This hook is the final stage in the [data resolving process](#resolved-data-stages), and is invoked after access control and field defaults are applied.

For field hooks, the return value should be an updated value for that specific field.
For list hooks, the return value should be a [`resolved data`](#resolved-data-stages) object.
The result of `resolveInput` will be passed as `resolvedData` into the next stages of the operation.

| `context`       | The [`KeystoneContext`](./context) object of the originating GraphQL operation.                                                                                                   |

```typescript
import { config, createSchema, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone/schema';
import { text } from '@keystone-next/fields';

export default config({
  lists: createSchema({
    ListName: list({
      hooks: {
        validateInput: async ({
          listKey,
          operation,
          originalInput,
          existingItem,
          resolvedData,
          context,
        }) => {
          /* ... */
          return resolvedData;
        },
      },
      fields: {
        fieldName: text({
          hooks: {
            validateInput: async ({
              listKey,
              fieldPath,

              return resolvedData[fieldName];
            },
          },
        }),
      },
    }),
  }),
});
```

### validateInput

The `validateInput` function is used to validate the [`resolvedData`](#resolved-data-stages) that will be saved during a `create` or `update` operation.

It is invoked after the `resolveInput` hooks have been run.

If the `resolvedData` is invalid then the function should report validation errors with `addValidationError(msg)` for list hooks, or `addFieldValidationError(msg)` for field hooks.
These error messages will be returned as a `ValidationFailureError` from the GraphQL API.

## Delete hooks

Delete hooks are called for all `delete` operations.
When deleting multiple values the hooks are called individually for each item being deleted.

### validateDelete

The `validateDelete` function is used to validate that deleting the selected item will not cause an issue in your system.

It is invoked after access control has been applied.

If the delete operation is invalid then the function should report validation errors with `addValidationError(msg)` for list hooks, or `addFieldValidationError(msg)` for field hooks.
These error messages will be returned as a `ValidationFailureError` from the GraphQL API.

## Resolved data stages

Create and update operations take a `data` value for a single item from the GraphQL input and then perform a number of _data resolving_ steps before writing the final value to the database.

At the start of an operation, `resolvedData` is set to be `data`.
At each stage of the data resolving process, the value of `resolvedData` can be modifed or augmented.
The final value of `resolvedData` is the value that will be validated and saved to the database.

The data resolving steps are applied in the following order:

1. Defaults (built in): Any fields which have a default value and are `undefined` in `resolvedData` will be set to their default value.
2. Relationships (built in): The values for relationship fields on `resolvedData` are either an ID string (for `one` relationships), or an array of ID strings (for `many` relationships).
   This is the format expected when saving relationship fields to the data.
   The value is computed by combining the provided `connect`, `create`, `disconnect`, and `disconnectAll` values with the existing data in the database.
   Any nested create operations are performed as part of this process.
3. Field values (built in): Some fields types take the value given in the GraphQL operation and convert it into a different type or format to be saved to the database.
4. Field hooks (user defined): A `resolveInput` field hook can return a new value for its field.
5. List hooks (user defined): A `resolveInput` list hook can return a new value for the entire `resolvedData` object.
