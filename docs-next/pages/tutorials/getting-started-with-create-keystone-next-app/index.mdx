# Getting started with `create-keystone-next-app`

[`create-keystone-next-app`](https://github.com/keystonejs/create-keystone-next-app) is a CLI app that makes it easier for you to get started with Keystone.
It will generate a couple files for you and install all the dependencies you need to run the AdminUI and start using the GraphQL API.

## Quick Start

```sh
yarn create keystone-next-app
cd my-app
yarn dev
```

## Installing your own Keystone instance

Open your preferred shell and make sure you are in the folder you would like to create your new project in.
`create-keystone-next-app` will generate a new folder with your new Keystone files in.

### Yarn

Use [`yarn create`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/create/):

```sh
cd your/path/
yarn create keystone-next-app
```

### npm

Use [`npm init`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-init):

```sh
npm init keystone-next-app
```

_(`npm init <initializer>` is available in npm 6+)_

### npx

Use npms [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx):

```sh
cd your/path/
npx create-keystone-next-app
```

_(npx comes with npm 5.2+)_

The cli will ask you to name your new app and for a way to connect to your database.
Make sure you have your connection url ready for your database like e.g. `postgres://localhost/my-app` or `postgres://username@localhost/my-app`.

_(If you run into trouble with the database, check out this guide on [Database Setup](https://www.keystonejs.com/quick-start/adapters))_

## Opening your shiny new AdminUI

After you ran `create-keystone-next-app` you can now `cd` into the folder that was created for you and run Keystone.

```sh
cd my-app
yarn dev
```

This will generate the AdminUI pages via [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

When you visit the AdminUI for the first time you will be presented with a handy screen that asked you to create a user.
Go ahead and create your first user.
