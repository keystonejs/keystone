# Date / Time Types Reboot

- [ ] Add a LocalDateTime field type
- [ ] Allow formatting the date in the field resolver (see <https://date-fns.org/v2.0.0-alpha.27/docs/Time-Zones>)

## CalendarDay

As per the current implementation

- [ ] Add a CalendarDay field type

## Time

New field type for storing a time of day.

> It would be nice to capture the intent of "this time of day, every day, regardless of time zone or offset" in a type.
> I imagine we'd store it as per the time part of an ISO 8601 string (ie. HH:mm:ss.nnn) with millisecond precision.
> â€“ <https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues/46#issuecomment-413743564>
