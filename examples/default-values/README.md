## Feature Example - Default Values

This example demonstrates how to use default values for fields.

This example builds on the [TODO](../usecase-todo) starter project.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally, run `pnpm install` at the root of the repository then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This will start Keystoneâ€™s Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where you can add items to an empty database.

When `NODE_ENV` is not equal to `production`, by default you can play with the GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql).

## Features
