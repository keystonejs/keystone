## Feature Example - Creating REST API endpoints

This project demonstrates how to create REST endpoints by extending Keystone's express app and using the Query API to execute queries against the schema.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally, run `pnpm install` at the root of the repository then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can use the Admin UI to create items in your database.

To run the seed data script, pass the `--seed-data` flag when starting the app.
