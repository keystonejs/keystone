# Keystone-Next eCommerce Example

👋 This is an example eCommerce backend implementation using KeystoneJS.

It is based on the [sick-fits backend](https://github.com/wesbos/advanced-react-rerecord) by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos), built as part of his [Advanced React Course](http://advancedreact.com)

Implementation and docs are WIP.

## Running the example

> **NOTE** you'll Cloudinary, Stripe, and SMTP credentials set up in your `.env` file or environment variables to run this example. See the `sample.env` file for required fields.

To run the project locally:

- Clone this repo
- Run `yarn` in the root (this repo is a monorepo and uses yarn workspaces, so that will install everything you'll need)
- Open this folder in your terminal and run `yarn dev`

If everything works 🤞 the GraphQL Server and Admin UI will start on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
