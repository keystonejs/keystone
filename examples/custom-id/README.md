## Base Project - Custom ID

This base project implements expands on the [Task Management](/examples/usecase-todo) example to demonstrate the use of custom string `id` fields.

We use the standard `Task` and `People` lists but, in addition, both lists:

- Add `db: { idField: { kind: 'string' } }` to support custom string identifiers for database rows
- Use a `resolveInput` hook that provides `id` values for `create` operations

In this case the id format is `${listKey}_${cuid2()}` (eg. `TASK_knu49p0kr0m9p7q79goxgrnh` or `PERSON_bpr7cdktsykgf486cmvqmfq1`) but any string format could be used.
If the `resolveInput` was exclude, the id fields would fall back to using standard `cuid` values â€“ the Keystone default.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally, run `pnpm install` at the root of the repository then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This will start Keystoneâ€™s Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where you can add items to an empty database.

You can also access Keystoneâ€™s GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql) to explore the GraphQL API, and run [queries](https://keystonejs.com/docs/guides/filters) and [mutations](https://keystonejs.com/docs/graphql/overview#mutations) on your data.

Congratulations, youâ€™re now up and running with Keystone! ðŸš€

### Optional: add sample data

This example includes sample data. To add it to your database:

1. Ensure youâ€™ve initialised your project with `pnpm dev` at least once.
2. Run `pnpm seed-data`. This will populate your database with sample content.
3. Run `pnpm dev` again to startup Admin UI with sample data in place.
