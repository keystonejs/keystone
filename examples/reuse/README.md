## Base Project - Reuse

This example demonstrates how to reuse lists, fields, hooks and other functions.
Navigatingn the types of these primitives can be difficult without experience, so hopefully this project helps you understand how you can apply this to your project.

Reuse is not encouraged typically, but it can be helpful in projects that have grown beyond having everything inline.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally, run `pnpm install` at the root of the repository then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This will start Keystoneâ€™s Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where you can add items to an empty database.

When `NODE_ENV` is not equal to `production`, by default you can play with the GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql).

## Try it out in CodeSandbox ðŸ§ª
