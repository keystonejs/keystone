## Base Project - JSON Field

This project demonstrates the usage of the json field.
It builds on the [Task Manager](../todo) starter project.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
yarn dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You can use the Admin UI to create items in your database.

You can also access a GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), which allows you to directly run GraphQL queries and mutations.

ðŸš€ Congratulations, you're now up and running with Keystone!

## Features

This example implements a `Packages` list. In this field we specify a pkgjson field which is a _required_ [`json` field type](https://next.keystonejs.com/apis/fields#json).
This accepts any valid JSON including:

- string node
- number node
- array node
- object node

As this is required, both inputting `null` in the admin-ui as well as leaving the input empty are not accepted. However try removing the `isRequired` config option from the field config. In doing so, you'll notice that both inputting the string `null` as well as an empty field will result in a null database value being stored.

The JSON field type stores its value in the `jsonb` format, as specified by Prisma. However if `sqlite` is specified as the database type instead, then the value is stored as a `string`.

## Next steps

This project is a bare bones system, and doesn't use any of Keystone's advanced features.
We encourage you to experiment with the code here to see how Keystone works, become familiar with the Admin UI, and learn about the GraphQL Playground.

Once you've got the hang of using this project, you can check out the [feature examples](../).
These projects build on this starter project and show you how to use Keystones advanced features to take your project to the next level.
