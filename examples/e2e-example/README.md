# Keystone Example - E2E Boilerplate

Boilerplate code to build E2E examples

## Running the example

1. Install dependencies

Make sure you are at the root of the repo and install dependencies.

```shell
yarn
```

2. Start Keystone and Next.js servers

Navigate from repo root to `examples/e2e-boilerplate` and start the servers.

```shell
yarn dev
```

The GraphQL Server and Admin UI will start on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The Next.js server will start and the homepage will be served at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

_You can alternatively open two terminals and navigate to `examples/e2e-boilerplate/keystone-server` and `examples/e2e-boilerplate/nextjs-frontend` and run `yarn dev` separately._
