## Feature Example - Testing

This project demonstrates how to write tests against the GraphQL API to your Keystone system.
It builds on the [`withAuth()`](../with-auth) example project.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally, run `pnpm install` at the root of the repository then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You can use the Admin UI to create items in your database.

You can also access a GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), which allows you to directly run GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Features

This example project uses this library to add tests to the [`withAuth()`](../with-auth) example project. The tests can be found in [example-test.ts](./example-test.ts). This example uses the built in `getContext` API to run tests against a Keystone Context

## Recommendations when Testing Keystone

When testing Keystone it is good to focus on Access Control, Hooks, Virtual Fields, Custom GraphQL extensions. Ideally these can be broken out into unit tests that test the individual function and its output - most of the time without even needing to use the Keystone Context. For higher level, end-to-end/integration tests, where you want to test a particular use case or user flow, you can then use `getContext`. It is highly recommended that you do not switch database providers for your tests as each provider can have slightly different functionality.

### Running tests

The project's `package.json` includes a script:

```
    "test": "node --loader tsx example-test.ts"
```

We can run the tests by running the command

```shell
pnpm test
```

which should give output ending with:

```
âœ” Create a User using the Query API (139.404167ms)
âœ” Check that trying to create user with no name (required field) fails (96.580875ms)
âœ” Check access control by running updateTask as a specific user via context.withSession() (193.86275ms)
