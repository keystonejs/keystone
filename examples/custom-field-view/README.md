## Base Project - Task Manager

This base project implements a simple **Task Management** app, with `Tasks` and `People` who can be assigned to tasks.

You can it as a starting place for learning how to use Keystone.
Itâ€™s also a starter for other [feature projects](../).

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
yarn dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can use the Admin UI to create items in your database.

You can also access a GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), which allows you to directly run GraphQL queries and mutations.

ðŸš€ Congratulations, you're now up and running with Keystone!

## Next steps

This project is bare bones, and doesn't use any of Keystone's advanced features.
We encourage you to experiment with the code here to see how Keystone works, become familiar with the Admin UI, and learn about the GraphQL Playground.

When you've got the hang of the Task Manager, try a [feature project](../) to learn Keystone's advanced features and take your knowledge to the next level.
