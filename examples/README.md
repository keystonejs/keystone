# Keystone Examples

Welcome to the Keystone Example ProjectsÂ ðŸ‘‹.
Here you'll find a collection of projects which show off the various features in Keystone.

You can use these examples as a jumping off point for adding features to your own Keystone project.

## Base Projects

There are two base projects which all the other examples build off.
The [`todo`](./todo) project is a basic task management application, while the [`blog`](./blog) project is a basic blogging app.

These projects have very simple schemas and none of the bells or whistles you'd expect in a complete project.
You can use these as a starting point for general experimentation in a clean environment.

## Feature Examples

Each of the examples below demonstrates a particular feature of Keystone.
You can use these projects to learn about, and experiment with specific features.
