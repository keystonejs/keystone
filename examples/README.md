# Keystone Examples

Welcome to the Keystone Example Projects 👋.
Here you'll find a collection of projects which show off the various features in Keystone.

You can use these examples as a jumping off point for adding features to your own Keystone project.

## Base Projects

There are two base projects which all the other examples build off.
The `todo` project is a basic task management application, while the `blog` project (coming soon) is a basic blogging app.

These projects have very simple schemas and none of the bells or whistles you'd expect in a complete project.
You can use these as a starting point for general experimentation in a clean environment.

## Feature Examples

Each of the examples below demonstrates a particular feature of Keystone.
You can use these projects to learn about, and experiment with specific features.

(coming soon)

## Solution Examples

The solution examples show you how to bring together all of the features of Keystone to build a complete product solution.
These examples show how the different features of Keystone work together in a more complex project.

(coming soon)

## Running examples

To run an example you should clone this repo and then run the following commands:

```
yarn
cd examples/<feature>
yarn dev
```

If everything works 🤞 the GraphQL Server and Admin UI will start on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
See the README in each example for more specific details.
