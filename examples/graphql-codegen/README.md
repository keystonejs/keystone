## Feature Example - Graphql types with GraphQL Code Generator

This project demonstrates how to generate GraphQL types using [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) for `context.graphql` in a Keystone project

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally, run `pnpm install` at the root of the repository then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You can use the Admin UI to create items in your database.

You can also access a GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), which allows you to directly run GraphQL queries and mutations.
