## Feature Example - virtual field

This project demonstrates how to add virtual fields to a Keystone list.
It builds on the [Blog](../blog) starter project.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally, run `pnpm install` at the root of the repository then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You can use the Admin UI to create items in your database.

You can also access a GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), which allows you to directly run GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Features

This project demonstrates how to use virtual fields.
It uses the `graphql` export from `@keystone-6/core` to define the GraphQL schema used by the virtual fields.
