## Base Project - Blog

This project is a base project which is used as a starter project for our other [feature examples](../).
It implements a basic blog, with `Posts` and `Authors`.

You can use this project as a starting place for learning how to use Keystone.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
yarn dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You can use the Admin UI to create items in your database.

You can also access a GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), which allows you to directly run GraphQL queries and mutations.

ðŸš€ Congratulations, you're now up and running with Keystone!

## Next steps

This project is a bare bones system, and doesn't use any of Keystone's advanced features.
We encourage you to experiment with the code here to see how Keystone works, become familiar with the Admin UI, and learn about the GraphQL Playground.

Once you've got the hang of using this project, you can check out the [feature examples](../).
These projects build on this starter project and show you how to use Keystones advanced features to take your project to the next level.
