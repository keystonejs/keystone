## Feature Example - Custom Field

This project demonstrates how to create a custom field that allows users to select a number of stars.
It builds on the [Blog](../blog) starter project.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
yarn dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You can use the Admin UI to create items in your database.

You can also access a GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), which allows you to directly run GraphQL queries and mutations.

The `stars` fields in the `stars-field` directory shows a custom field.
