## Feature Example - Custom Field

This project demonstrates how to create different types of custom fields

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally, run `pnpm install` at the root of the repository then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You can use the Admin UI to create items in your database.

You can also access a GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), which allows you to directly run GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Custom Fields

### 1 - Text Field

A simple custom text field with no validation, useful for exploring the building blocks of a custom field.

### 2 - Stars field

The `stars` fields in the `2-stars-field` directory shows a custom field that validates that the value is between 0 and some maximum number of stars and shows a radio input to select the number of stars in the Admin UI. The backend for the field type is in `stars-field/index.ts` and the frontend is in `stars-field/views.tsx`.

### 3 - Pair Field

A custom text field with no validation, which is stored as two columns in the database, `left` and `right`.
This example explores how you can use the `dbField.kind === 'multi'` to distribute data from a custom field across multiple columns in your Prisma model.
