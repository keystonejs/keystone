# Keystone-6 eCommerce Example

ðŸ‘‹ This is an example eCommerce backend implementation using KeystoneJS.

It is based on the [sick-fits backend](https://github.com/wesbos/advanced-react-rerecord) by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos), built as part of his [Advanced React Course](http://advancedreact.com)

Implementation and docs are WIP.

## Running the example

> **NOTE** you'll need Cloudinary, Stripe, and SMTP credentials set up in your `.env` file or environment variables to run this example. See the `sample.env` file for required fields.

To run the project locally:

- Clone the https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone repository
- Run `yarn` at the root directory of the repository [(we use yarn workspaces)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/)
- Navigate to this directory and run `yarn dev`

If everything works ðŸ¤ž the GraphQL Server and Admin UI will start on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
