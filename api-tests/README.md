# API Tests

Keystone, as a system, can be summarised as `schema => ({ api, adminUI })`.
This directory contains system level test to ensure that `schema => ({ api })` behaves as expected.
These system level tests should be considered complimentary to the unit tests contained in each package.
Tests for `schema => ({ adminUI })` can be found in the `test-projects` directory.
