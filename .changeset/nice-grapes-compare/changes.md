Added alpha channel support to the `Color` field. NOTE: This introduces a backwards-compatible change in the format saved to the database. The old format was a 6-character hex string preceded by a `#`, eg; `#663399`. The new format is an `rgba` string, eg; `rgba(102, 51, 153, 1)`. Both formats are fully supported in CSS, and the `Color` field will correctly handle old values stored in the hex format.
