Removed the `name` argument to `setupServer`. This value will now be autogenerated by the test system. If you would like to use a specific name you can still pass through `{ keystoneOptions: { name: '...' } }` to retain the original behaviour.

```
setupServer({ name: 'foo', adapterName, createLists, ... });
```

can now be written as

```
setupServer({ adapterName, createLists, ... })
```

or, if you would like the `Keystone` instance to have a specific name,

```
setupServer({ adapterName, createLists, keystoneOptions: { name: 'foo' }, ... })
```
