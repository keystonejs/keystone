- **Blocks**
  - Blocks must now be classes, which implement the `Block` interface.
  - `type` is no longer passed to a Block's constructor (it is expected to know it already).
  - Remove the `embed` block
  - `Block#dependencies` is removed; any depended upon views should be returned from `Block#getAdminViews()`.
  - `Block#extendAdminMeta()` is renamed to `Block#getViewOptions()`.
  - Add new `Block#getAdminViews()` method.
- **Field Types**
  - `Field#extendViews()` is renamed to `Field#extendAdminViews()`.
