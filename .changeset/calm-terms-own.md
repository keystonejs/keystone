'@keystonejs/app-admin-ui': patch
---

Fixed a few minor usability issues with item sorting:
- Fixed list view sort indicator pointing the wrong way. Previously, it would unintuitively point down for ascending down and vice-versa for descending.
- Fixed Sort Select popup losing focus when pressing Alt.
