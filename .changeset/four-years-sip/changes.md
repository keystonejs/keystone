- API Changes to Adapters:
    - Configs are now passed directly to the adapters rather than via `adapterConnectOptions`. 
    - Default connections strings changed for both Knex and Mongoose adapters to be more inline with system defaults.
    - `keystone.connect()` no longer accepts a `to` paramter - the connection options must be passed to the adapter constructor (as above).
