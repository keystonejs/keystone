# @keystone-next/prisma-utils

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#6490](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/6490) [`ca48072b4`](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/commit/ca48072b4d137e879e328c93b703a8364562db8a) Thanks [@renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate)! - Updated Prisma package dependencies to `3.0.2`. See the [Prisma release notes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/3.0.1) for full details of the changes.

  Note that Keystone continues to use the "binary" query engine, rather than the new "node-API" query engine, which is now the Prisma default. We are still performing tests to ensure that the node-API query engine will work well with Keystone.
