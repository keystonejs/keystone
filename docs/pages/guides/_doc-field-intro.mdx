The [`document`](../apis/fields#document) field type is a highly customizable rich text editor that lets content creators quickly and easily edit content in your system.

It's built with [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org/), stores your content as JSON-structured data, and lets you do things like:

- Configure the types of formatting used in your documents
- Easily render the document in your application
- Insert relationships to other items in your Keystone database
- Define your own custom editor blocks based on React Components

## Try the demo ↓

export default ({ children }) => children;
