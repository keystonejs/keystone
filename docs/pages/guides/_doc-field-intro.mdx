The [`document`](../apis/fields#document) field type is a highly customizable rich text editor that lets content creators quickly and easily edit content in your system.

It's built with [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org/), stores your content as JSON-structured data, and lets you do things like:

- Embed multi-column layouts (that your front-end can decide how to render)
- Insert relationships to other items in your Keystone database
- Define your own custom blocks based on React Components
- Choose between automatically generated forms for editing Component Props, or create your own custom Component UI and Toolbars

## Try the demo â†“

export default ({ children }) => children;
