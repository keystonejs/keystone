# Keystone 5 vs Next. Which should you use?

?> Updated March 31st, 2021. See our [roadmap](https://next.keystonejs.com/roadmap) for the latest improvements.

Keystone 5 is now in **maintenance mode**. We‘re focusing all our efforts on Keystone Next, to be released as Keystone 6 later this year. If you’re wondering which version to start your next project with, this guide is for you.

---

**TL;DR:** Both versions are production ready. Use Keystone 5 if you need a stable, battle-tested foundation to build on today. If you’re happy to manage a few updates over the coming months then Keystone Next is what you want.

## What’s changing between Keystone 5 and 6

There are a few major things that will change between 5 and 6 which we’re currently implementing in Keystone Next:

- New field types. Including a new [Document field](../guides/document-fields) field which replaces the old Content field.
- New [configuration syntax](../apis/config) and [CLI](../guides/cli).
- New express-independent session system.
- New internal APIs for querying lists.
- Completely new Admin UI.

### DB adapters out. Prisma in.

We’re also moving away from maintaining several database adapters to just using **Prisma**, which simplifies things. Until Prisma supports MongoDB (which is [currently in Early Access](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mongodb)) we’ll have a gap in our database support.

There are also differences between Knex and Prisma for Postgres users, which mainly matter for advanced use cases like migrations and raw SQL, etc.

## Keystone Next is production ready

Thinkmill is already running Keystone Next in production (including [rugby.com.au](https://www.rugby.com.au/)) so we do rate it as stable from a runtime perspective; but from an API perspective it is still evolving fairly regularly.

## Feature parity

We’ve stripped back quite a few field types (like `File` and `Url`) and some other functionality during the transition from 5 to 6. These will all be coming back, but **we’re not at feature parity yet**.

While parity isn’t far off, if you need something urgently that Next doesn’t include then that might answer the question for you.

## Next APIs & supporting Docs are evolving

Next APIs aren’t 100% stable yet. We’ve published docs for most of the APIs in Keystone Next, but there’s a lot more we have to write.

- If you need stable APIs and comprehensive documentation right now choose Keystone 5.
- If you’re OK spending a bit of time keeping up with changes over the year choose Next. It will be easier to transition from Next to 6 when the major release lands.

## Transitioning projects

Transitioning projects from Keystone 5 to 6 will be possible, but it won’t be a simple process of tweaking the configuration.

You’ll have to rewrite your config, schema, session and access control functions, at a minimum. We don't want it to be hard -- the sort of thing you can do in a day or two. You’ll be fundamentally configuring the same things, but it’ll be quite different.

## Next vs 5: Pros & Cons

### Keystone Next

#### Pros

- The latest and greatest (Keystone Next is already _much better_ than Keystone 5).
- Awesome new [document field](/guides/document-fields).
- Better Admin UI (with more improvements planned).
- Built on more modern foundations.
- Easier to deploy with database migrations.
- If you keep on top of the updates, you won’t hit a major upgrade wall for quite a while.

#### Cons

- You’ll need to keep on top of changes as we keep evolving Keystone Next into a more complete and stable API.
- Docs aren’t comprehensive yet.
- Less battle tested (we have spent a lot of effort bringing our entire test suite forward and keeping it green, but there will always be things we could miss this early on).
- You should only use Postgres as the database back-end at this point.

### Keystone 5

#### Pros

- Stable, well documented, battle tested.
- Not going to change much going forward, so your codebase will also be stable. No API churn.
- More comprehensive features (for example, more field types at this point that Keystone Next).

#### Cons

- It won’t be changed much going forward, so it’s a case of “use it if it works for you” at this point.
- You’ll have a moderate rewrite ahead of you to upgrade to Keystone 6 if you want the new stuff.
- If you’re starting from scratch with a new project, it’s more complex to configure and (aside from next docs being incomplete) and harder to learn.
