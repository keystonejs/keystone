# Hooks

Keystone provides a powerful CRUD GraphQL API which lets you perform basic operations on your data.
As your system evolves you'll find that you need to include business logic alongside these operations.

In this guide we'll show you how to use `hooks` to enhance the core operations in different ways.
For full details of the function signatures, please check out the [Hooks API](../apis/hooks).

## What is a hook?

A hook is a function you define as part of your [schema configuration](../apis/schema) which is executed when a GraphQL operation is performed.
Let's look at a basic example to log a message to the console whenever a new user is created.

```typescript
import { config, createSchema, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone/schema';
import { text } from '@keystone-next/fields';

export default config({
  lists: createSchema({
    User: list({
      fields: {
        name: text(),
        email: text(),
       },
      hooks: {
        afterChange: ({ operation, updatedItem }) => {
          if (operation === 'create') {
            console.log('New user created. Name: ${updatedItem.name}, Email: ${updatedItem.email});
          }
        }
      },
    }),
  }),
});
```

This function will be triggered whenever we execute one of `createUser`, `createUsers`, `updateUser`, or `updateUsers` in our GraphQL API.
It will be executed once for each item either created or updated.
Because we only want to log when a user is created, we check the value of the `operation` argument.
We then use the `updatedItem` argument to get the value of the newly created user.

Now that we've got a sense of what a hook is, let's look at how we can use hooks to solve some common problems you'll hit when creating your system.

## Modifying incoming data

When a `create` or `update` operation is called, you might want to apply some pre-processing to the data before saving it to your database.
For example, if you have a blog post, you might want to ensure that the `title` field always starts with an upper-case letter.
The `resolveInput` hook lets use take the data which has been provided to the GraphQL mutation and modify it before it is saved.

Let's write a hook which takes the data for a blog post and converts the first letter to be upper-cased.

```typescript
import { config, createSchema, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone/schema';
import { text } from '@keystone-next/fields';

export default config({
  lists: createSchema({
    Post: list({
      fields: {
        title: text({ isRequired: true }),
        content: text({ isRequired: true }),
       },
      hooks: {
        resolveInput: ({ resolvedData }) => {
          const { title } = resolvedData;
          if (title) {
            // Ensure the first letter of the title is capitalised
            resolvedData.title = title[0].toUpperCase() + title.slice(1)
          }
          // We always return resolvedData from the resolveInput hook
          return resolvedData;
        }
      },
    }),
  }),
});
```

!> We must always return the modified `resolvedData` value from our hook, even if we didn't end up changing it.

The `resolveInput` hook is called whenever we update or create an item.
The value of `resolvedData` will contain the input provided to the mutation itself, along with any `defaultValues` applied on fields.
If you just want to see what the original input before default values was, you can use the `originalInput` argument.

If you're performing an update operation, you might also want to access the current value of the item stored in the database.
This is available as the `existingItem` argument.

Finally, all hooks are provided with a `context` argument, which gives you access to the full [context API](../apis/context).


?> The `resolveInput` hook shouldn't be used to set default values. This is handled by the `defaultValue` field config option.

## Validating inputs

Before writing the resolved data to the database you will often want to check that it conforms to certain rules, depending on your application's needs.
For example, you might want to ensure that blog posts dont have a blank title.
An empty string, `""`, is a perfectly valid `String` value to pass into GraphQL.
Let's use a validation hook to ensure that this value doesn't make it into our database.

```typescript
import { config, createSchema, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone/schema';
import { text } from '@keystone-next/fields';

export default config({
  lists: createSchema({
    Post: list({
      fields: {
        title: text({ isRequired: true }),
        content: text({ isRequired: true }),
       },
      hooks: {
        validateInput: ({ resolvedData, addValidationError }) => {
          const { title } = resolvedData;
          if (title === '') {
            // We call addValidationError to indicate an invalid value.
            addValidationError('The title of a blog post cannot be the empty string');
          }
        }
      },
    }),
  }),
});
```

The `validateInput` hook is passed the `resolvedData` value after all defaults and `resolveInput` hooks have been completed.
This is the value which will be written into the database if no validation errors are found.

We can check the values on this object and if there's a problem we call the function `addValidationError` with an error message.
There might be multiple problems with the input, so you can call `addValidationError` multiple times to capture of all the different problems.

Keystone will abort the operation and convert these error messages into GraphQL errors which will be returned to the caller.

The `validateInput` hook also receives the `operation`, `originalInput`, `existingItem` and `context` arguments if you want to perform more advanced checks.

?> Don't confuse data **validation** with **access control**! If you want to check whether a user is **allowed** to do something, you should set up [access control rules](./access-control).

## Triggering side-effects

When data is changed in our system we might want to trigger some external side-effect.
For example, we might want to send a welcome email to a user when they first create their account.
We can use the `beforeChange` and `afterChange` hooks to do this.
Let's send an email after a user is created.

```typescript
import { config, createSchema, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone/schema';
import { text } from '@keystone-next/fields';
// Keystone leaves it up to you to decide how best to implement email in your system
import { sendWelcomeEmail } from './lib/welcomeEmail';

export default config({
  lists: createSchema({
    User: list({
      fields: {
        name: text(),
        email: text(),
       },
      hooks: {
        afterChange: ({ operation, updatedItem }) => {
          if (operation === 'create) {
            sendWelcomeEmail(updatedItem.name, updatedItem.email);
          }
        }
      },
    }),
  }),
});
```

The `beforeChange` and `afterChange` hooks are very similar, but serve slightly different purposes.
The `beforeChange` hook receives a `resolvedData` argument, which contains the data we're about to write to the database, whereas `afterChange` recieves `updatedItem`, which contains the data that was written to the database.

If the `beforeChange` hook throws an exception then the operation will return an error, and the data will not be saved to the database.
If the `afterChange` hook throws an exception then the data will remain in the database. As such, `afterChange` hooks should be used where a failure to execute isn't a critical problem.

## Delete hooks

The hooks discussed above all relate to the `create` and `update` operations.
There are also hooks which can be defined for the `delete` operation.

The `delete` operation hooks are `validateDelete`, `beforeDelete`, and `afterDelete`.

The `validateDelete` is used to verify that deleting an item won't cause a problem in your system.
For example, deleting a user might leave a collection of blog posts without authors, which might be something you want to avoid.

Similary, the `beforeDelete` and `afterDelete` hooks can be used to trigger side-effects related to the delete operation.

## List hooks vs field hooks

All of the examples above have involved hooks associated with a particular list.
Keystone also supports setting of hooks associated with a particular field.
All the same hooks are available, and they receive all the same arguments, along with an extra `fieldPath` argument.

Field hooks can be useful if you want to have field specific rules.
For example, you might have an email validation function which want to use in your system.
You could always write this as a list hook, but it will make your code more clear if you write this as a field hook.

```typescript
import { config, createSchema, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone/schema';
import { text } from '@keystone-next/fields';

export default config({
  lists: createSchema({
    User: list({
      fields: {
        name: text(),
        email: text({
          hooks: {
            validateInput: ({ addValidationError, resolvedData, fieldPath }) => {
              const email = resolvedData[fieldPath];
              if (email !== undefined && email !== null && !email.includes('@')) {
                addValidationError('The email address ${email} provided for the field ${fieldPath} must contain an '@' character);
              }
            },
          },
        }),
       },
    }),
  }),
});
```

See the [fields API](../apis/hooks) for the details of all the arguments available for all the different hook functions.
