### Prisma migrations 🚚

- We updated `keystone-next dev` with the Prisma adapter so that it interactively prompts for creating and applying migrations.
- `createKeystone` and `createSystem` also accept a migration mode now instead of a script.
- `keystone-next generate` now uses Prisma's programmatic APIs to generate migrations and it accepts the following options as command line arguments or as prompts:
  - `--name` to set the name of the migration
  - `--accept-data-loss` to allow resetting the database when it is out of sync with the migrations
  - `--allow-empty` to create an empty migration when there are no changes to the schema.

### Noteworthy bug-squashing 🐛

Now you can include negative values for `float`, `decimal` and `integer` fields. 🎉

You can also view the [verbose release notes](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/releases/tag/2021-03-22) on GitHub.
