We've added support for MySQL to Keystone's list of database providers, bringing the total number of supported database types to three.

Here's an example `db.config` to work with MySQL database.

```js
export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'mysql',
    url: 'mysql://dbuser:dbpass@localhost:3306/keystone',
    idField: { kind: 'uuid' },
  },
  ...
});
```

There are some differences in how Postgres and MySQL operate so be sure to checkout our new [choosing the right database guide](https://keystonejs.com/docs/guides/choosing-a-database).

For more info, check out our [Pull Request - Add support for MySQL](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/7538).
