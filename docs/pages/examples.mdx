# Examples

Keystone has a wide range of highly configurable features.

Our [examples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/examples) is a growing collection of projects you can run locally to learn more about a particular feature of Keystone.

Every project comes with its own docs that explain the how and why.
They're useful as a reference for best practice, and as a jumping off point when adding features to your own Keystone project.
