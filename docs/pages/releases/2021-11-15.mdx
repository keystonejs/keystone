## Expanded Unique Filters 🔎

`select`, `timestamp`, `float` and `decimal` fields with `isIndexed: 'unique'` now have unique filters via `ListWhereUniqueInput` which `text`, `integer` and the `id` field already support.

For example, if you added `isIndexed: 'unique'` to a select field in a theoretical **Settings** list, you can now run the following query:

```ts
query {
  setting ( where: { provider: "github" } ) {
		id
		token
  }
}
```

This is instead of running a settings query where you would have received a list back, and have had to check for results and get the first element:

```ts
query {
  settings ( where: { provider: { equals: "github" } } ) {
		id
		token
  }
}
```

## Customisable Table and Column Names <Emoji symbol="📇" alt="Index cards" />

You may now use different table and column names to those automatically chosen by Keystone for your list and field keys. This is powered by Prisma's [@map](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#map) and [@@map](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#map) attributes. You can read more about this concept in [Prisma's documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/use-custom-model-and-field-names).

This is useful if you do not want to modify your existing database (such as a read-only database) and use it with Keystone.

For example if you wanted to refer to a table named `stories` but you refer to it in Keystone as `Posts` provide `config.db.map` to a list or field key such as:

```
Post: list({
  db: {
    map: 'stories',
  },
  fields: {
    ...
  }
})
```

## Nexus Example <Emoji symbol="🪢" alt="Rope" />

We've got a [new example](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/main/examples/extend-graphql-schema-nexus) using [Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/), a declarative, code-first and strongly typed GraphQL schema construction for TypeScript & JavaScript.

Using Nexus you can extend the GraphQL API provided by Keystone with custom queries and mutations.

In the example below we expose a mutation called `nexusPosts` which pulls out items from our `Posts` list that have been published within the past 7 days (by default), with an optional author filter.

```ts
export const PostQuery = extendType({
	type: 'Query',
	definition(t) {
		t.field('nexusPosts', {
			type: nonNull(list('NexusPost')),
			args: {
				authorId: stringArg(),
				days: nonNull(intArg({ default: 7 })),
			},
			async resolve(root, { authorId, days }, context) {
				const cutoff = new Date(
					new Date().setUTCDate(new Date().getUTCDate() - days)
				).toISOString();

				return await context.prisma.post.findMany({
					where: {
						...(authorId ? { author: { id: authorId } } : null),
						publishDate: { gt: cutoff },
					},
				});
			},
		});
	},
});
```

## Miscellaneous Fixes <Emoji symbol="⚙️" alt="Gear" />

- The format of the date shown in the `DatePicker` now uses the user's locale.
- When the `sessionData` option is invalid, the error will now be thrown on startup instead of silently ignored.
