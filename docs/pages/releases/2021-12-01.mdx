# Release: 1st December 2021

This release marks the achievement of **General Availability** status for Keystone 6! <Emoji symbol="🚀" alt="Rocket"/>

We’ve also included a range of improvements to Keystone’s TypeScript DX since shipping [last week’s release candidate](/releases/2021-11-24).

## Keystone 6 <Emoji symbol="⚡️" alt="Lightning" />

With this major release, the project has moved to the `@keystone-6` namespace on npm, and our version numbers have been reset.

We **highly recommend you upgrade** your existing **Keystone Next** projects to **Keystone 6** with the packages below:

```json
"@keystone-6/auth": "1.0.0",
"@keystone-6/cloudinary": "1.0.0",
"@keystone-6/document-renderer": "1.0.0",
"@keystone-6/fields-document": "1.0.0",
"@keystone-6/core": "1.0.0",
"@keystone-6/session-store-redis": "1.0.0",
```

?> **Note:** `@keystone-next/keystone` has been changed to `@keystone-6/core`

Among other internal naming changes, our CLI commands have switched from `keystone-next` to simply `keystone`, please ensure you update your startup scripts to suit!

## Type Enhancements <Emoji symbol="✨" alt="Sparkles" />

We've shipped a significant update to our generated TypeScript types.

The types for your schema are stricter when your lists are contextually typed by the newly provided `Lists` types from `.keystone/types`.
This results in a smoother, type-safe auto-complete experience and stricter types for your access control, hooks, and any other code that uses a Keystone context.

For example, if you write all your lists in one object:

```ts
import { Lists } from '.keystone/types'

export const lists: Lists = {
  Blah: list({...})
}
```

If you're defining your lists separately, you can do this:

```ts
import { Lists } from '.keystone/types'

export const Blah: Lists.Blah = list({
  ...
})
```

For a more in-depth view of what TypeScript types have been changed, see below:

- The following types have been renamed:
  - `BaseGeneratedListTypes` → `BaseListTypeInfo`
  - `ItemRootValue` → `BaseItem`
  - `ListInfo` → `ListGraphQLTypes`
  - `TypesForList` → `GraphQLTypesForList`
  - `FieldTypeFunc` now has a required type parameter which must satisfy `BaseListTypeInfo`
- The following types now have a required type parameter which must satisfy `BaseKeystoneTypeInfo`:
  - `ServerConfig`
  - `CreateRequestContext`
  - `AdminUIConfig`
  - `DatabaseConfig`
  - `ListOperationAccessControl`
  - `MaybeSessionFunction`
  - `MaybeItemFunction`
- `GraphQLResolver` and `GraphQLSchemaExtension` now have a required type parameter which must satisfy `KeystoneContext`
- `KeystoneGraphQLAPI` no longer has a type parameter
- The first parameter to the resolver in a `virtual` field will be typed as the item type if the list is typed with `Keystone.Lists` or `Keystone.Lists.ListKey`, otherwise it will be typed as `unknown`
- The `item`/`originalItem` arguments in hooks/access control will now receive the `Item` type if the list is typed with `Keystone.Lists` or `Keystone.Lists.ListKey`, otherwise it will be typed as `BaseItem`
- `args` has been removed from `BaseListTypeInfo`
- `inputs.orderBy` and `all` has been added to `BaseListTypeInfo`
- In `.keystone/types`:
  - `ListKeyListTypeInfo` has been moved to `Lists.ListKey.TypeInfo`
  - `KeystoneContext` has been renamed to `Context`
