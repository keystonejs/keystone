# Release: 2nd June 2021

## What's New

We have a new JSON field <Emoji symbol="✨" alt="Sparkle"/>, a bunch of new learning resources, and plenty of under the hood optimisations in this big release. <Emoji symbol="💪" alt="Muscle"/>

```typescript
"@keystone-next/adapter-prisma-legacy": "8.0.0",
"@keystone-next/admin-ui-utils": "5.0.1",
"@keystone-next/auth": "26.0.0",
"@keystone-next/cloudinary": "5.0.1",
"@keystone-next/fields": "10.0.0",
"@keystone-next/fields-document": "6.0.1",
"@keystone-next/keystone": "19.0.0",
"@keystone-next/test-utils-legacy": "20.0.0",
"@keystone-next/types": "19.0.0",
"@keystone-next/utils-legacy": "11.0.1",
```

### JSON Field <Emoji symbol="👩🏻‍💻" alt="Person at laptop"/>

Thanks to the new `json` field, you can now represent JSON blobs in your backend. Check out the [JSON example project](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/examples/json) to learn more.

```
Package: list({
  fields: {
    pkgjson: json({ isRequired: true }),
    isPrivate: checkbox(),
    ownedBy: relationship({ ref: 'Person.packages', many: false }),
  },
}),
```

### More Learning Resources <Emoji symbol="🧑‍🏫" alt="Student at blackboard"/>

In addition to the JSON one above, we added new examples for:

- Setting [Default Values](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/examples/default-values) for fields.
- [Extending the GraphQL Schema](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/examples/extend-graphql-schema) with custom queries and mutations.

We also published a tutorial that shows you [how to embed Keystone and SQLite in a Next.js app](https://keystonejs.com/tutorials/embedded-mode-with-sqlite-nextjs). The end result is an app with a queryable GraphQL endpoint based on your Keystone schema that you can run live on Vercel – for free! <Emoji symbol="🚀" alt="Rocket"/>

### sortBy deprecated with improvements to orderBy

We deprecated the `sortBy` GraphQL filter and updated the `orderBy` GraphQL filter with an improved API.

Previously a `User` list's `allUsers` query would have the argument:

```graphql
orderBy: String
```

The new API gives it the argument:

```graphql
orderBy: [UserOrderByInput!]! = []
```

where

```graphql
input UserOrderByInput {
  id: OrderDirection
  name: OrderDirection
  score: OrderDirection
}

enum OrderDirection {
  asc
  desc
}
```

Rather than writing `allUsers(orderBy: "name_ASC")` you now write `allUsers(orderBy: { name: asc })`. You can also order by multiple fields, e.g. `allUsers(orderBy: [{ score: asc }, { name: asc }])`.

Note: each `UserOrderByInput` must have exactly one key, or else an error will be returned.

### withItemData replaced with sessionData <Emoji symbol="🔧" alt="Wrench"/>

We removed `withItemData` in favour of a `sessionData` option to the `createAuth()` function.

Previously, `withItemData` would be used to wrap the `config.session` argument:

```typescript
import { config, createSchema, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone/schema';
import { statelessSessions, withAuthData } from '@keystone-next/keystone/session';
import { text, password, checkbox } from '@keystone-next/fields';
import { createAuth } from '@keystone-next/auth';

const { withAuth } = createAuth({
  listKey: 'User',
  identityField: 'email',
  secretField: 'password',
});

const session = statelessSessions({ secret: '-- EXAMPLE COOKIE SECRET; CHANGE ME --' });

export default withAuth(
  config({
    lists: createSchema({

        fields: {
          email: text({ isUnique: true }),
          password: password(),
          isAdmin: checkbox(),
        },
      }),
      session: withItemData(session, { User: 'id isAdmin' }),
    }),
  })
);
```

Now, the fields to populate are configured on sessionData in createAuth, and withItemData is completely removed.

```typescript
import { config, createSchema, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone/schema';
import { statelessSessions } from '@keystone-next/keystone/session';
import { text, password, checkbox } from '@keystone-next/fields';
import { createAuth } from '@keystone-next/auth';

const { withAuth } = createAuth({
  listKey: 'User',
  identityField: 'email',
  secretField: 'password',
  sessionData: 'id isAdmin',
});

const session = statelessSessions({ secret: '-- EXAMPLE COOKIE SECRET; CHANGE ME --' });

export default withAuth(
  config({
    lists: createSchema({

        fields: {
          email: text({ isUnique: true }),
          password: password(),
          isAdmin: checkbox(),
        },
      }),
      session,
    }),
  })
);
```

### More consistent and predictable createItems, updateItems, and deleteItems mutations <Emoji symbol="🧘‍♀️" alt="Meditator"/>

We fixed the behaviour of `createItems`, `updateItems`, and `deleteItems` mutations to be consistent and predictable.

Previously, these mutations could return items in an arbitrary order. They now return items in the same order they were provided to the mutation.

Previously, if there was an error (e.g. validation) on one or more of the items – the return value would be `null` and a single top level error would be returned. The state of the database in this case was non-deterministic.

The new behaviour is to return values for all items created, with `null` values for those that had errors. These errors are returned in the `errors` array and have paths which correctly point to the `null` values in the returned array. All the valid operations will be completed, leaving the database in a deterministic state.

Previously, if items were filtered out by declarative access control, then no error would be returned, and only those accessible items would be returned. Now the returned data will contain `null` values for those items which couldn't accessed, and the `errors` array will contain errors with paths which correctly point to the `null` values in the returned array.

Previously, if static access control denied access to the mutation, then `null` was returned, and a single `error` was returned. Now, an array of `null`s is returned, with a separate error for each object. This makes the behaviour of static and declarative access control consistent.

### Counts Improved <Emoji symbol="🔢" alt="1 2 3 4"/>

The GraphQL field `_all<path>Meta { count }` generated for `many` relationships has been deprecated in favour of a new field `<path>Count`, which directly returns the count.

A `posts` relationship field would have the following field added to the API:

```graphql
postsCount(where: PostWhereInput! = {}): Int
```

### Prisma updated to 2.24.0 <Emoji symbol="⬆️" alt="Up arrow"/>

We've updated our Prisma dependency from `2.22.1` to `2.24.0`! Check out the [Prisma release notes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases) for more details.
