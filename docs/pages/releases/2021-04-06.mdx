## What's New

### Controlled code demolition <Emoji symbol="🏗️" alt="Construction crane"/> <Emoji symbol="👷‍♀️" alt="Female with work hat"/>

We pruned a lot of code from the Keystone garden – cutting out the dead wood to make way for a more efficient and productive core in Keystone 6. Notable changes include:

- Removed Keystone‘s DB adapters and the `db.adapter` config option (now that Keystone 6 uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) under the hood).
- Said goodbye to a bunch of redundant methods and arguments for the same reasons as above.
- Exchanged `deploy`, `reset` and `generate` commands for `keystone-next prisma` e.g:
  - `keystone-next deploy` -> `keystone-next prisma migrate deploy`

### Better pagination in Admin UI <Emoji symbol="✨" alt="Sparkle"/>

Pagination in the Admin UI has fresh styles and is easier to use.
