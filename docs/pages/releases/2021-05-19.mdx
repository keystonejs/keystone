### Node updates :rocket:

Node.JS engines in our packages have been updated to `12.x` and `14.x` to keep up to date with the latest versions of our dependencies.

### Admin UI package moved :truck:

`@keystone-next/admin-ui` now lives inside `@keystone-next/keystone/admin-ui`.

If you were directly importing from `@keystone-next/admin-ui` you can now import the same items from `@keystone-next/keystone/admin-ui`.

⚠️ Please remove references to `@keystone-next/admin-ui` in your `package.json` files.

export default ({ children }) => <Markdown>{children}</Markdown>;
