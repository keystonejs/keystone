## Upgrade Guide <Emoji symbol="üëá" alt="Finger Pointing Down" />

Be sure to read the entire release notes below for everything you need to know about this new release.

The main things to keep in mind are:

- `defaultValue` config is now static, if you have dynamic defaults, use the `resolveInput` hook
- `isRequired` for fields is now `validation: { isRequired }` and we have new validation options such as `min` and `max` for some fields
- We've made it clearer which fields are nullable in the database and tweaked the defaults, you now have more control but may need to migrate your database (more details below)
- The `hooks` API has new arguments, and we‚Äôve consolidated update and delete events into `beforeOperation` and `afterOperation`
- `context.lists` has been renamed to `context.query`

## Fields Overhaul <Emoji symbol="üöÄ" alt="Rocket" />

Keystone‚Äôs field types have been given a big overhaul - including several breaking changes, read on to understand what has changed.

?> Some of these API changes are **breaking** and you will be required to update your project.

### text

- `defaultValue` is now a static value
- `isRequired` has moved to `validation.isRequired`
- Now requires that the value has a length of at least one
- New `validation.length.min`, `validation.length.max` and `validation.match` options

### float

- `defaultValue` is now a static number
- `isRequired` has moved to `validation.isRequired`
- New `validation.min` and `validation.max` options

### integer

- `defaultValue` is now a static number or `{ kind: 'autoincrement' }`
- `isRequired` has moved to `validation.isRequired`
- New `validation.min` and `validation.max` options

The `autoIncrement` field has also been removed, use the integer field with a `defaultValue` of `{ kind: 'autoincrement' }`.

### decimal

- `defaultValue` is now a static number written as a string
- `isRequired` has moved to `validation.isRequired`
- Now requires the input isn't `NaN`
- New `validation.min` and `validation.max` options

### timestamp

- `defaultValue` is now a static date time value in an ISO8601 string or `{ kind: 'now' }`
- `isRequired` has moved to `validation.isRequired`

The field can also be automatically set to the current time on a create/update by setting `db.updatedAt: true`, this will add Prisma's `@updatedAt` attribute to the field.

The `timestamp` field also now uses a custom GraphQL scalar type named `DateTime` which requires inputs as full ISO8601 date-time strings such as `"2021-01-30T00:00:00.000Z"`. Using `new Date().toISOString()` will give you a string in the correct format.

### select

- `dataType` has been renamed to `type`
- `defaultValue` is now a static value
- `isRequired` has moved to `validation.isRequired`

The `select` can now also be cleared in the Admin UI when `ui.displayMode` is `segmented-control`.

### password

- `defaultValue` has been removed
- `isRequired` has moved to `validation.isRequired`
- `rejectCommon` has moved to `validation.rejectCommon`
- `minLength` has moved to `validation.length.min`
- New `validation.length.max` and `validation.match` options

`validation.length.min` also must be `1` or above, though it still defaults to `8`.

If `workFactor` is outside of the range of `6` to `31`, an error will now be thrown instead of the previous behaviour of clamping the value to `4` to `31` and warning if it's below `6`.

### image

- Removed `isRequired`
- Removed `defaultValue`

If you were using these options, the same behaviour can be re-created with the `validateInput` and `resolveInput` hooks respectively.

### file

- Removed `isRequired`
- Removed `defaultValue`

If you were using these options, the same behaviour can be re-created with the `validateInput` and `resolveInput` hooks respectively.

### cloudinaryImage

- Removed `isRequired`
- Removed `defaultValue`

If you were using these options, the same behaviour can be re-created with the `validateInput` and `resolveInput` hooks respectively.

### json

- Removed `isRequired`
- `defaultValue` can no longer be dynamic in the `json` field

If you were using `isRequired`, the same behaviour can be re-created with the `validateInput` hook.

### relationship

- Removed `defaultValue`
- Removed undocumented `withMeta` option

To re-create `defaultValue`, you can use `resolveInput` though note that if you're using autoincrement ids, you need to return the id as number, not a string like you would provide to GraphQL, e.g. `{ connect: { id: 1 } }` rather than `{ connect: { id: "1" } }`.

If you were using `withMeta: false`, please [open an issue](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues/new) with your use case.

### checkbox

The `checkbox` field is now non-nullable in the database, if you need three states, you should use the `select` field.

The field no longer accepts dynamic default values and it will default to `false` unless a different `defaultValue` is specified.

If you're using SQLite, Prisma will generate a migration that makes the column non-nullable and sets any rows that have null values to the `defaultValue`.

If you're using PostgreSQL, Prisma will generate a migration but you'll need to modify it if you have nulls in a checkbox field. Keystone will say that the migration cannot be executed:

```
‚ú® Starting Keystone
‚≠êÔ∏è Dev Server Ready on http://localhost:3000
‚ú® Generating GraphQL and Prisma schemas
‚ú® There has been a change to your Keystone schema that requires a migration

‚ö†Ô∏è We found changes that cannot be executed:

  ‚Ä¢ Made the column `isAdmin` on table `User` required, but there are 1 existing NULL values.

‚úî Name of migration ‚Ä¶ make-is-admin-non-null
‚ú® A migration has been created at migrations/20210906053141_make_is_admin_non_null
Please edit the migration and run keystone-next dev again to apply the migration
```

The generated migration will look like this:

```sql
/*
  Warnings:

  - Made the column `isAdmin` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.

*/
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "User" ALTER COLUMN "isAdmin" SET NOT NULL,
ALTER COLUMN "isAdmin" SET DEFAULT false;
```

To make it set any null values to false in your database, you need to modify it so that it looks like this but with the table and column names replaced.

```sql
ALTER TABLE "User" ALTER COLUMN "isAdmin" SET DEFAULT false;
UPDATE "User" SET "isAdmin" = DEFAULT WHERE "isAdmin" IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE "User" ALTER COLUMN "isAdmin" SET NOT NULL;
```

### document

The `document` field is now non-nullable in the database. The field no longer has `defaultValue` or `isRequired` options.

The same behaviour can be re-created with the `validateInput` and `resolveInput` hooks respectively.

The field will default to `[{ "type": "paragraph", "children": [{ "text": "" }] }]`. The output type has also been renamed to `ListKey_fieldKey_Document`

If you're using SQLite, Prisma will generate a migration that makes the column non-nullable and sets any rows that have null values to an empty paragraph.

If you're using PostgreSQL, Prisma will generate a migration but you'll need to modify it if you have nulls in a `document` field.

Keystone will say that the migration cannot be executed:

```
‚ú® Starting Keystone
‚≠êÔ∏è Dev Server Ready on http://localhost:3000
‚ú® Generating GraphQL and Prisma schemas
‚ú® There has been a change to your Keystone schema that requires a migration

‚ö†Ô∏è We found changes that cannot be executed:

  ‚Ä¢ Made the column `content` on table `Post` required, but there are 1 existing NULL values.

‚úî Name of migration ‚Ä¶ make_document_field_non_null
‚ú® A migration has been created at migrations/20210915050920_make_document_field_non_null
Please edit the migration and run keystone-next dev again to apply the migration
```

The generated migration will look like this:

```sql
/*
  Warnings:

  - Made the column `content` on table `Post` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.

*/
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "Post" ALTER COLUMN "content" SET NOT NULL,
ALTER COLUMN "content" SET DEFAULT E'[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}]';
```

To make it set any null values to an empty paragraph in your database, you need to modify it so that it looks like this but with the table and column names replaced.

```sql
ALTER TABLE "Post" ALTER COLUMN "content" SET DEFAULT E'[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}]';
UPDATE "Post" SET "content" = DEFAULT WHERE "content" IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE "Post" ALTER COLUMN "content" SET NOT NULL;
```

### general

`text`, `float`, `integer`, `decimal`, `timestamp`, `select`, `password` can be made non-nullable at the database-level with the `isNullable` option which defaults to `true`, except for `text` which defaults to `false`.

All fields above except `password` can also have:

- `graphql.read.isNonNull` set if the field has `isNullable: false` and you have no read access control and you don't intend to add any in the future, it will make the GraphQL output field non-nullable.

- `graphql.create.isNonNull` set if you have no create access control and you don't intend to add any in the future, it will make the GraphQL create input field non-nullable.

Keep in mind, `checkbox` is now [always non-nullable](#checkbox).

## Hook Updates <Emoji symbol="ü™ù" alt="Hook" />

We've consolidated the `beforeChange`/`beforeDelete` and `afterChange`/`afterDelete` hooks into `beforeOperation` and `afterOperation`.

Additionaly, we've renamed:

- `originalInput` for access control functions to `inputData`

- `originalInput` for hook functions to `inputData`

- `existingItem` for all hooks (except `afterOperation`) to `item`

- `existingItem` for `afterOperation` to `originalItem`

- `updatedItem` for `afterOperation` to `item`

See the [Hooks API docs](https://keystonejs.com/docs/apis/hooks) for a complete reference for the updated API!

## Removals <Emoji symbol="üö´" alt="Removals" />

Some unused return types and unused values from enum definitions have been removed:

- `sendUserPasswordResetLink` and `sendUserMagicAuthLink` only ever return `null`, so now have return types of `Boolean`.
- `UserAuthenticationWithPasswordFailure` no longer has a `code` value.
- `MagicLinkRedemptionErrorCode` and `PasswordResetRedemptionErrorCode` no longer have the values `IDENTITY_NOT_FOUND`, `MULTIPLE_IDENTITY_MATCHES`, `TOKEN_NOT_SET`, or `TOKEN_MISMATCH`.

If you were using the `createSchema` function, you can also remove the call to `createSchema` and pass the lists directly to the `lists` property.

Before:

```
import { config, createSchema, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone';

config({
  lists: createSchema({
   User: list({ ... }),
  }),
})
```

After:

```
import { config, list } from '@keystone-next/keystone';

config({
  lists: {
   User: list({ ... }),
  },
 })
```

We've removed the deprecated `config.db.adapter` option. Please use `config.db.provider` to indicate the database provider for your system.

Finally, the internal `protectIdentities` variable which was previously hardcoded to `true` to protect user data, there are no immediate plans to implement this as a configurable option.

## Renames <Emoji symbol="üìá" alt="Card Index" />

The API `context.lists` has been renamed to `context.query`, and `context.db.lists` has been renamed to `context.db`.

The `skipAccessControl` argument to `createContext` to `sudo` for consistency with `context.sudo()`.

When using the experimental option `config.experimental.generateNodeAPI`, the `api` module now exports `query` rather than `lists`.

Renamed `graphQLReturnFragment` to `ui.query` in the virtual field options. The virtual field now checks if `ui.query` is required for the GraphQL output type, and throws an error if it is missing. If you don't want want the Admin UI to fetch the field, you can set `ui.itemView.fieldMode` and `ui.listView.fieldMode` to `'hidden'` instead of providing `ui.query`.

Also, we've moved the `graphql` export of `@keystone-next/keystone/types` to `@keystone-next/keystone`.

## Improved Error Messaging <Emoji symbol="üìü" alt="Message" />

Error messages have been improved across the board, in summary:

- On startup, we now output where the GraphQL API is located
- If access is denied errors are thrown, we now state which operation isn't permitted
- Bad relationship field inputs are detected and outputed
- Clearer distinction if a user input is invalid
- If access control functions return invalid values we state what we got and what we expected
- Improved the error messages provided from the GraphQL API when extension code (e.g access control functions, hooks, etc) throws exceptions
- Better formatting of GraphQL error messages resulting from Prisma errors
- Clearer sign-in errors when logging into the Admin UI
- Improved error messages when returning bad filters from filter access control

## Performance <Emoji symbol="üöÖ" alt="High Speed Train" />

### Field Mode

We've optimised the `itemView` field mode fetching - we now only fetch the item once to determine the field modes rather than once per field.

The Admin UI will also skip fetching fields that have a statically set `itemView.fieldMode: 'hidden'` on the `itemView`.

The `id` argument to the `KeystoneAdminUIFieldMeta.itemView` GraphQL field can now be omitted which will make `KeystoneAdminUIFieldMetaItemView.fieldMode` return null when there isn't a static field mode.

The `itemView` also no longer uses a sudo context when fetching the item in the `KeystoneAdminUIFieldMetaItemView.fieldMode`. Previously, if someone had access to the Admin UI(`ui.isAccessAllowed`) and a field had a `itemView.fieldMode` function that used the `item` argument, someone could bypass access control to determine whether or not an item with a given id exists.

### Query Generation Performance

Query generation performance has been improved when querying single relationships without filter-based access control.

When resolving related items, we often have a foreign key available to us that we can use to help optimise the subsequent related item query. If, on top of this, there are no filter-based access control rules in place, then we can use the Prisma findUnique operation, which will group all the operations into a single database query. This solves the GraphQL N+1 query problem in this specific instance.

## REST API Example <Emoji symbol="üë©‚Äçüè´" alt="Teacher" />

This release also adds `createContext` to the `extendExpressApp` function giving you access to the full context API from Keystone.

In a [new example](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/examples/rest-api) we demonstate how to create REST endpoints by extending Keystone's express app and using the Query API to execute queries against the schema.

## Other Notable Changes <Emoji symbol="üõéÔ∏è" alt="Bell" />

- The `KeystoneAdminUIFieldMeta.isOrderable` and `KeystoneAdminUIFieldMeta.isFilterable` fields are no longer statically resolvable and will now take into account the context/session. This also means `isOrderable` and `isFilterable` are no longer accessible on `useList().fields[fieldKey].isOrderable/isFilterable`, they can be fetched through GraphQL if you need them in the Admin UI.

- The `sendItemMagicAuthLink` and `sendItemPasswordResetLink` mutations now always return `true` instead of always returning `null`

- Added support for dynamic `isFilterable` and `isOrderable` field config values. If a function is provided for these config option, it will be dynamically evaluated each time the field is used for filtering and ordering, and an error will be returned if the function returns `false`.

## Apollo Server Upgrade <Emoji symbol="üë©‚ÄçüöÄ" alt="Astronaut" />

Apollo Server has had a major upgrade to [Version 3](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration/).

The Apollo documentation contains a full list of breaking changes introduced by this update.

You can configure the Apollo Server provided by Keystone using the [`graphql.apolloConfig`](https://keystonejs.com/docs/apis/config#graphql) configuration option.

The most prominent change for most users will be that the **GraphQL Playground** has been replaced by the **Apollo Sandbox**.

If you prefer to keep the **GraphQL Playground**, you can configure your server by [following these instructions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration/#graphql-playground).

## Prisma Update <Emoji symbol="üóÉ" alt="Card File Box" />

We've updated our Prisma dependency from `2.30.2` to `3.1.1`!

Note that Keystone continues to use the "binary" query engine, rather than the new "node-API" query engine, which is now the Prisma default. We are still performing tests to ensure that the node-API query engine will work well with Keystone.

Check out the [Prisma releases page](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases) for more details on this major update.
