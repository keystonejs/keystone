## What's New

## Improvements to the Lists API

To make the [Lists API](https://next.keystonejs.com/docs/apis/schema) (i.e `context.lists.{List}`) more intuitive to use, we **deprecated the `resolveFields` option** in favour of two new methods:

### 1. Specify a string of fields to return with the **new `query` option**:

Use this when you want to query for resolved field values (including querying relationships and virtual fields). This replaces the `resolveFields: false` use case. Now you can query a Post like so:

```js
const [post] = await context.lists.Post.findMany({
  where: { slug },
  query: `
    title
    content
    image {
      src
      width
      height
    }`,
});
```

### 2. Return the unresolved item data with read hooks

This **replaces the `resolveFields: boolean` use case**. We now have a new set of APIs on `context.db.lists.{List}` which return unresolved item data from your database (but with read hooks applied). They can be referenced directly or returned from a custom mutation or query in the GraphQL API to be handled by the Field resolvers.

For example, to query for the raw data stored in the database:

```js
const [post] = await context.db.lists.Post.findMany({
  where: { slug },
});
```
