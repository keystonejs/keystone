## What's New

Apollo [cache hinting](https://keystonejs.com/docs/apis/schema#graphql) can now be configured on a per list or field basis — which can dramatically improve your applications performance.

Implementing basic authentication? We've got [another example](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/examples/with-auth) using `withAuth` from the `auth` package to get you started <Emoji symbol="🔒" alt="Lock"/>.

Focus control is now handled better in the Keystone UI, see [the PR](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/5670) for the before and after.

Thanks to @cameronbraid for spotting a [session issue](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/5727/files) and resolving it <Emoji symbol="🐛" alt="Bug"/>.
