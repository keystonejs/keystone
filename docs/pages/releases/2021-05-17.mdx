## What's New

Apollo [cache hinting](https://next.keystonejs.com/apis/schema#graphql) can now be configured on a per list or field basis — which can dramatically improve your applications performance 🔥.

Implementing basic authentication? We've got [another example](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/examples/with-auth) using `withAuth` from the `auth` package to get you started 🔒.

Focus control is now handled better in the Keystone UI, see [the PR](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/5670) for the before and after 👀!

Thanks to @cameronbraid for spotting a [session issue](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/5727/files) and resolving it 🐛.
