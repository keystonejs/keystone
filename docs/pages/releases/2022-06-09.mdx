# Release: 9th June 2022

## New features <Emoji symbol="⭐" alt="Star" />

### Array Fields and Components Blocks <Emoji symbol="🔀" alt="Shuffle" />

?> **Warning**: This new feature includes breaking changes that may affect you

Changes to the underlying document-editor component block interfaces, with the addition of array fields. The breaking changes are only for defining components, _no database migration is needed_.

The breaking changes for `@keystone-6/fields-document/component-blocks` are:

- <Emoji symbol="⚠️" alt="Warning" /> For the arguments of the `component` function, rename `component` to `preview`
- <Emoji symbol="⚠️" alt="Warning" /> For the arguments of the `component` function, rename `props` to `schema`
- <Emoji symbol="⚠️" alt="Warning" /> For your component `.schema` (previously `.props`), rename `props.{innerFieldName}` to `props.fields.{innerFieldName}`.
- <Emoji symbol="⚠️" alt="Warning" /> When rendering child field React components, change `props.{innerFieldName}` to `props.{innerFieldName}.element`.

For example, use `props.fields.title` instead of `props.title`.
For a nested example, use `props.fields.someObject.fields.title` instead of `props.someObject.title`.

### Images and Files <Emoji symbol="🖼️" alt="Picture" />

?> **Warning**: This new feature includes breaking changes that may affect you

The `image` and `files` configuration options [have been removed](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/7070) from Keystone's configuration, and a new `storage` configuration object introduced.

- <Emoji symbol="➕" alt="Plus" /> Amazon S3 (and other compatible providers) are now supported when uploading images and files
- <Emoji symbol="➕" alt="Plus" /> New Guide coming - see #7563 will be merged soon but check it out if you are keen
- <Emoji symbol="🚨" alt="Alert" /> Images and files are now - **DELETED BY DEFAULT** from the underlying storage provider when replaced or deleted from the database
- **Note**: A `preserve` flag has been added to the new storage configurations to default back to the previous behaviour
- <Emoji symbol="⚠️" alt="Warning" /> If you were previously using refs in your application, you need to migrate your database

#### Could not find prisma-fmt binaries

[A number of users](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/discussions/7461) have reported problems with the Prisma binaries not being installed properly by their package manager.

As part of [pull request #7595](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/7595) the Prisma binaries are now downloaded just before they're needed.
Note this should not happen in production, they should still be downloaded before as part of your deployment step.
