## Added support for SQLite with Prisma <Emoji symbol="🎉" alt="Party popper"/>

You can now use SQLite to store your data via Prisma. The SQLite rollout also includes support for the `File` and `Cloudinary` field types.

## Noteworthy bug-squashing <Emoji symbol="🐛" alt="Bug"/>

Mitchell [solved a bug](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/5168) where `withItemData` returned sessions that don't match an item, rather than treating them as invalid.

You can also view the [verbose release notes](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/releases/tag/2021-03-23) on GitHub.
