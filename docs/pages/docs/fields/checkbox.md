title: "Checkbox"
description: "A reference of Keystone's checkbox field type, configuration and options."
---

A `checkbox` field represents a boolean (`true`/`false`) value.

Options:

- `defaultValue` (default: `false`): This value will be used for the field when creating items if no explicit value is set.
- `db.map`: Adds a [Prisma `@map`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#map) attribute to this field which changes the column name in the database
- `graphql.isNonNull.read` (default: `false`): If you have no read access control and you don't intend to add any in the future,
  you can set this to true and the output field will be non-nullable. This is only allowed when you have no read access control because otherwise,
  when access is denied, `null` will be returned which will cause an error since the field is non-nullable and the error
  will propagate up until a nullable field is found which means the entire item will be unreadable and when doing an `items` query, all the items will be unreadable.
- `graphql.isNonNull.create` (default: `false`): If you have no create access control and you want to explicitly show that this is field is non-nullable in the create input
  you can set this to true and the create field will be non-nullable and have a default value at the GraphQL level.
  This is only allowed when you have no create access control because otherwise, the item will always fail access control
  if a user doesn't have access to create the particular field regardless of whether or not they specify the field in the create.

```typescript
import { config, list } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { checkbox } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

export default config({
  lists: {
    SomeListName: list({
      fields: {
        someFieldName: checkbox({
          defaultValue: true,
          db: { map: 'my_checkbox' },
          graphql: {
            isNonNull: {
              read: true,
              create: true,
            },
          }
        }),
        /* ... */
      },
    }),
    /* ... */
  },
  /* ... */
});
