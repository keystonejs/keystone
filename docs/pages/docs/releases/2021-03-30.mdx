## What's New

### Goodbye legacy code 👋 🌇

We removed a few legacy items including:

- Field types `CalendarDay`, `DateTime`, `Slug`, `Url`, and `Uuid`.
- Arguments `cookieSecret`, `cookie`, and `sessionStore` from the Keystone constructor.
- Arguments `schemaName`, `schemaNames`, `keystoneOptions`, and `graphqlOptions` were unused and have been removed from the `setupServer()` function (which we also removed).

### Improved select field type 🔽

It now uses the correct underlying type, which lets you make use of { dataType: 'enum' } and { dataType: 'integer'}.

### Squashed bugs 🐛

We fixed a bug that existed in `updateMany` on lists with declarative access control.

You can also view the [verbose release notes](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/releases/tag/2021-03-30) on GitHub.
