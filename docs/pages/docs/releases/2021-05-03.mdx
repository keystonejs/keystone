## What's New

This release involved a bunch of busywork behind the scenes in Keystone Next. Stripping away all the things we don't need now that we're using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) exclusively. The end of the cleanup is in sight, and we're getting closer to the point where we can start working on some great new features.

**Files in Keystone Next 📁**. Now you can use Admin UI to upload local files to your repo using SQLite. We also added a `maxFileSize` property for easier project config.

You can also view the [verbose release notes](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/releases/tag/2021-05-03) on GitHub.
