# Access Control API

?> We recently improved this API so it’s easier to program, and makes it harder to introduce security gaps in your system. If you were using it prior to September 6th 2021, [read this guide](/updates/new-access-control) for info on how to upgrade.

The `access` property of the [list configuration](./schema) object configures who can query, create, update, and delete items in your Keystone system.
The `access` property of the [field configuration](./fields) object configures who can read, create, and update specific field values of an item.

```typescript
import { config, list } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

export default config({
  lists: {
    ListKey: list({
      fields: {
        fieldName: text({ access: { /* ... */ }, }),
      },
      access: { /* ... */ },
    }),
  },
});
```

## List Access Control

Keystone provides support for access control and filtering on a per-list basis.
By default, all lists and fields are public without additional configuration.

There are three types of access control that can be configured on the `access` object:

- [`operation`](#operation), functions which provide the `context` and `session` to help decide if a request should be granted access to the list; this happens prior to any GraphQL query being executed.
- [`filter`](#filter), functions which return a [filter](./filters) that is applied to database queries on this list.
- [`item`](#item-mutations-only), functions which provides the `context` and `session` to determine if a request can execute the respective mutative action.

Each of these types of access control are applied before [hooks](./hooks).

?> Please note that Keystone does not automatically configure nor leverage database row security policies or row level security

!> **Access denied:** **Mutations** return `null` data with an access denied error. **Queries** never return access denied errors, and instead treat items as if they didn't exist.

If access is **denied** due to any of the access control methods, the following responses will be returned from the GraphQL API:

- **Mutations**
  - **Single** operations return `null` and an access denied error.
  - **Multi** operations return a data array with `null` values for the items which have access denied.
    Error responses are returned for each `null` item.
- **Queries**
  - **Single** item queries return `null` with no errors.
  - **Many** item queries filter out items which have access denied. No error responses are returned.
  - **Count** queries will only count those items for which access is **not** denied. No error responses are returned.

### Operation

Operation-level access control lets you control which operations can be accessed by a user based on the `session` and `context`.
Individual functions can be provided for each of the operations.

?> Each operation type *defaults to public* unless configured.

!> These functions must return `true` if the operation is allowed, or `false` if it is not allowed.

```typescript
import { config, list } from '@keystone-6/core';

export default config({
  lists: {
    ListKey: list({
      access: {
        operation: {
          query: ({ session, context, listKey, operation }) => true,
          create: ({ session, context, listKey, operation }) => true,
          update: ({ session, context, listKey, operation }) => true,
          delete: ({ session, context, listKey, operation }) => true,
        }
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

?> The `query` access control is applied only when running GraphQL query operations.
A user can still **read** fields as part of a return query when using a mutation `operation` (`create`, `update` or `delete`).
If you want to limit access to fields, use [field access control](https://keystonejs.com/docs/apis/access-control#field-access-control).

### Filter

Filter-level access control lets you restrict which items can be operated on by providing a function which returns a [GraphQL filter](./filters).

- For **mutations**, the access control filter will be combined with the unique identifier provided to the operation, and access will be denied if no item is found with this combined filter.
- For **queries**, the access control filter will be combined with the query filter and only items which match both filters will be returned.

In general, the filter access control functions will return GraphQL filters.
They can also return boolean values `true` or `false` to match or exclude all items.

?> Each `filter` type *defaults to an empty filter*, unless configured.

```typescript
import { config, list } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { checkbox } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

export default config({
  lists: {
    ListKey: list({
      fields: {
        isReadable: checkbox(),
        isUpdatable: checkbox(),
        isDeletable: checkbox(),
      }
      access: {
        filter: {
          query: ({ session, context, listKey, operation }) => {
            return { isReadable: { equals: true } };
          },
          update: ({ session, context, listKey, operation }) => {
            return { isUpdatable: { equals: true } };
          },
          delete: ({ session, context, listKey, operation }) => {
            return { isDeletable: { equals: true } };
          },
        }
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

!> Filter based access control cannot be used for `create` operations.
If you want to limit `create` operations, use either `access.operation.create` or `access.item.create`.

?> Filter based access control can impact the performance of your database queries.

### Item (mutations only)

Item-level access control lets you control which mutative operations can be applied to a list item.
Individual functions can be provided for each of the operations, with each function receiving:

- the **input data** of the mutation (for `create` and `update` operations), and or
- the **existing item** in the database (for `update` and `delete` operations).

?> Each `item` access type *defaults to public* unless configured.

!> These functions must return `true` if the operation is allowed, or `false` if it is not allowed.

```typescript
import { config, list } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { checkbox } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

export default config({
  lists: {
    ListKey: list({
      access: {
        item: {
          create: ({ session, context, listKey, operation, inputData }) => true,
          update: ({ session, context, listKey, operation, inputData, item }) => true,
          delete: ({ session, context, listKey, operation, item }) => true,
        }
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

?> Item-level access control is not available for `query` operations.
Applying access control after fetching items would lead to inconsistent pagination behaviour and incorrect `count` results.

### Function Arguments

List-level access control functions are passed a collection of arguments which can be used to determine whether the operation is allowed.

| Argument    | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `session`   | The current session object. See the [Sessions API](./session) for details.                                    |
| `context`   | The [`KeystoneContext`](./context) object of the originating GraphQL operation.                               |
| `listKey`   | The key of the list being operated on.                                                                        |
| `operation` | The operation being performed (`'query'`, `'create'`, `'update'`, `'delete'`).                                |
| `inputData` | For `create` and `update` operations, this is the value of `data` passed into the mutation. (Item level only) |
| `item`      | The existing item being updated/deleted in `update` and `delete` operations. (Item level only)                |

## Field Access Control

Keystone also allows you to set up access control on a per-field basis.
Rules can be set for `read`, `create` and `update` operations.

!> Each operation is defined by a function which returns `true` if access is allowed and `false` if access is not allowed.

### Mutations

Field-level access control rules are applied **after** the list level access rules have been applied.
Access control rules are only applied to the fields that have an input value provided to the mutation.
If any of the provided fields fail their access control check, the whole operation is aborted.
The GraphQL API then returns `null` along with an access denied error.

### Read

Field-level access control rules are applied when trying to resolve a field on the output type.
If access is denied then the query will still return an item object, but the specific field will return `null`.
No errors will be returned for `read` access denied.

!> The `read` access control is applied to fields returned from both **queries** and **mutations**.

```typescript
import { config, list } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

export default config({
  lists: {
    ListKey: list({
      fields: {
        fieldName: text({
          access: {
            read: ({ session, context, listKey, fieldKey, operation, item }) => true,
            create: ({ session, context, listKey, fieldKey, operation, inputData }) => true,
            update: ({ session, context, listKey, fieldKey, operation, inputData, item }) => true,
          },
        }),
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

!> Field-level access control is not available for `delete` operations. Restrict `delete` operations at the List-level instead with `access.operation.delete`, `access.filter.delete` or `access.item.delete`.

### Function Arguments

Field-level access control functions are passed a collection of arguments which can be used to determine whether the operation is allowed.

| Argument    | Description                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `session`   | The current session object. See the [Sessions API](./session) for details.                  |
| `context`   | The [`KeystoneContext`](./context) object of the originating GraphQL operation.             |
| `listKey`   | The key of the list being operated on.                                                      |
| `fieldKey`  | The key of the field being operated on.                                                     |
| `operation` | The operation being performed (`'read'`, `'create'`, `'update'`).                           |
| `inputData` | For `create` and `update` operations, this is the value of `data` passed into the mutation. |
| `item`      | The existing item being read/updated in `read` and `update` operations.                     |
