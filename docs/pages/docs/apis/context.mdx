# Context API

The `KeystoneContext` object is the primary API entry point for all of the run-time functionality of your Keystone system.
In GraphQL, a [`context`](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers) is a value which is provided to every resolver and holds important contextual information such as the currently logged in user, or access to a database.
Keystone makes a `KeystoneContext` object available as the context of all resolvers in the system.
The APIs provided by the `KeystoneContext` object can be used to write the business logic for things like [access control](../guides/access-control), [hooks](../guides/hooks), [testing](../guides/testing) and GraphQL [schema extensions](../guides/schema-extension).

The `KeystoneContext` object has the following properties, which are documented below.

```typescript
import type { KeystoneContext } from '@keystone-6/core/types';

context = {
  // HTTP request object
  req,

  // Query API
  query,

  // Internal DB object API
  db

  // GraphQL helpers
  graphql: {
    schema,
    run,
    raw,
  };

  // Session API
  session,
  startSession,
  endSession,

  // New context creators
  sudo,
  exitSudo,
  withSession,

  // Database access
  prisma,

  // Images API
  images: {
    getUrl,
    getDataFromRef,
    getDataFromStream,
  },

  // Internal state
  totalResults,
  maxTotalResults,

  // Deprecated
  gqlNames,
};
```

### HTTP request object

`req`: The [IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object from the HTTP request which called the GraphQL API.

### Query API

`query`: The [Query API](./query), which can be used to perform CRUD operations against your GraphQL API and return a queried value.

### Database API

`db`: The [Database API](./db-items), which can be used to perform CRUD operations against your GraphQL API and return database objects suitable for return from mutations in [schema extensions](../guides/schema-extension).

### GraphQL helpers

`graphql.schema`: The [GraphQL Schema](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema) object, which can be used directly, or via `graphql.raw`, `graphql.run`, or the `lists` API.

`graphql.raw`: An async function which takes `({ query, variables })` and executes the query against the GraphQL schema, returning `{ data, errors }`.
`query` can be either a string or a GraphQL [`Document`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/language/#parse).
`variables` is an optional object containing the input variables for the query.
The returned object is an [`ExecutionResult`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/execution/).
This query uses the current `context` object as its `context`.

`graphql.run`: An async function which takes `({ query, variables })` and executes the query against the GraphQL schema, returning `data`.
`query` can be either a string or a GraphQL [`Document`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/language/#parse).
`variables` is an optional object containing the input variables for the query.
The returned object is an [`ExecutionResult.data`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/execution/).
Any errors generated by the query will be thrown as an exception.
This query uses the current `context` object as its `context`.

See the [schema extension guide](../guides/schema-extension) for examples of using these functions.

### Session API

If you configure your Keystone system with session management then you will have access to the following properties.
See the [session API](./session#session-context) for more details.

`session`: The current session data object.

`startSession`: An internal helper function used by authentication mutations to start a session on a successful login. This should not be called directly.

`endSession`: An internal helper function used by authentication mutations to end a session on logout. This should not be called directly.

### New context creators

When using the `context.query`, `context.graphql.run`, and `context.graphql.raw` APIs, access control and session information is passed through to these calls from the `context` object.
The following functions will create a new `KeystoneContext` object with this behaviour modified.

`sudo()`: A function which returns a new `KeystoneContext` object with all access control disabled and all filters enabled for subsequent API calls.

`exitSudo()`: A function which returns a new `KeystoneContext` object with all access control re-enabled for subsequent API calls.

`withSession(newSession)`: A function which returns a new `KeystoneContext` object with the `.session` object replaced with `newSession`.

### Database access

The `KeystoneContext` object exposes the underlying database driver directly via `context.prisma`, which is a [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference) object.

### Images API

If [support for image fields](./config#images) is enabled in the system, then an `images` API will be made available on the `context` object.
This API takes advantage of the following types:

```
type ImageMode = 'local';

type ImageExtension = 'jpg' | 'png' | 'webp' | 'gif';

type ImageData = {
  mode: ImageMode;
  id: string;
  extension: ImageExtension;
  filesize: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
};
```

`image.getUrl(mode, id, extension)`: Given a `mode`, `id`, and `extension` from an `ImageData` object, returns the `src` value representing the location from which the image can be accessed over HTTP.

`async images.getDataFromRef(ref)`: Given a `ref` string, taken from the `id` field of an existing image, returns an `ImageData` object.

`async images.getDataFromStream(stream)`: Given a readable data stream, returns an `ImageData` object. The `mode` will be taken from `config.images.mode`, and `id` will be a `uuid` value. The other values will be inferred from the data stream itself. The contents of the stream will be written to the filesystem at `config.images.local.storagePath`.

### Internal state

These properties are used internally by Keystone and generally do not need to be directly accessed.

`totalResults`: The cumulative total number of results returned by the current request. See [`config.graphql.queryLimits`](./config#graphql).

`maxTotalResults`: The maximum number of results which can be returned before a query limit error is triggered. See [`config.graphql.queryLimits`](./config#graphql).

### Deprecated

The following properties are deprecated and should not be used.
They will be removed in future releases.

`gqlNames`: A function which takes a `listKey` and returns an object containing the GraphQL query, mutation and type names related to that list.
