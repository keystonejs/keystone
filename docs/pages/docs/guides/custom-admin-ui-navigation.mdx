# Custom Admin UI Navigation

In this guide, we'll illustrate how to create a custom Navigation component with custom routes to be rendered in the Admin-UI.

## Creating your custom Navigation component

### Navigation props

Keystone passes the following props to your custom Navigation component:

```ts
type NavigationProps {
    lists: ListMeta[];
    authenticatedItem: AuthenticatedItem;
}
```

`lists` is an array of list objects that include amongst other things routing information to be rendered by the custom Navigation component.

```ts
type ListMeta = {
  // key is used as the unique key for each navigation item in React.
  key: string;
  // href to the list route in the Admin-UI.
  path: string;
  // Used as the label for each navigation item.
  label: string;
  /** There are other properties as well */
};

```

`authenticatedItem` is a union of potential authentication states, expanded on below:

```ts
type AuthenticatedItem =
  | { state: 'unauthenticated' }
  | { state: 'authenticated'; label: string; id: string; listKey: string }
  | { state: 'loading' }
  | { state: 'error'; error: Error | readonly [GraphQLError, ...GraphQLError[]] };
```

This should be handled for you automatically by passing the prop into the `NavigationContainer`,

!> `NavigationContainer` is one of many assistive components to help you more easily compose your custom Navigation component. You can read more about it down [below](#components).

?> If you wish to render out the `authenticatedItem` in a custom manner, please be aware that you will need to handle all of the possible states of the `authenticatedItem`. Explaining how to do this is out of the scope of this particular guide.

### Components

Keystone exposes a variety of helper components to make building out your custom Admin-UI Navigation component easier. These are:

- [NavigationContainer](#navigation-container)
- [ListNavItems](#list-nav-items)
- [ListNavItem](#list-nav-item)
- [NavItem](#nav-item)

#### NavigationContainer

This is component renders containing markup around your routes, as well as as the different stats of the authenticatedItem prop.

```tsx
import { NavigationContainer} from '@keystone-next/keystone/admin-ui/components'
```

#### ListNavItems

This component takes the provided Array of `lists` and renders out a list of NavItems.

```tsx
import { ListNavItems } from '@keystone-next/keystone/admin-ui/components'
```

As mentioned above the lists object has the following type:

```typescript
type lists = ListMeta[]
type include = string[]
```

If an include prop is supplied, the component will only render out lists that match the list `keys` specified in the include array.

```tsx
const CustomNavigation = ({ lists }) => (
  <NavContainer>
    <ListNavItems lists={lists} include={["Task"]} />
  </NavContainer>
)
```

![example of navigation with include prop values](/assets/guides/custom-admin-ui-navigation/listNavItems-with-include.png)

Otherwise, all lists will be added.

```tsx
const CustomNavigation = ({lists}) => (
  <NavContainer>
    <ListNavItems lists={lists}/>
  </NavContainer>
)
```

![example of navigation without include prop values](/assets/guides/custom-admin-ui-navigation/listNavItems-without-include.png)

#### ListNavItem

The ListNavItem component takes a single `list` object and renders a `NavItem`. This is a thin wrapper around `NavItem`, that automates the association of list properties to NavItem.
It also adds a custom `isSelected` expression optimised for keystone lists.

```tsx
import { ListNavItem } from '@keystone-next/keystone/admin-ui/components';
```

It expects the following props.

```typescript
type ListNavItemProps = {
  list: ListMeta;
};
```

The impetus behind `ListNavItem` is to have a higher-level abstraction that can allow users to not have to care about the contents and structure of our lists.
This is especially relevant for future feature additions to the nav. (i.e. if we add icon support, that would work out of the box from a dependency bump for users of ListNavItem, whereas you'd have to add that icon prop manually leveraging a lower level component.)

Use this component when you want to have more granular control over rendering nav items from lists prop provided to the `Navigation` component by keystone,
but would still like to not have to care about which list properties need to be associated with each NavItem prop.

#### NavItem

This component is a thin styling and accessibility wrapper around the Link component from Next.js

```tsx
import { NavItem } from '@keystone-next/keystone/admin-ui/components'
```

It expects the following props.

```ts
type NavItemProps = {
   // The path or URL to navigate to
  href: string,
  // React children of the component
  children: ReactNode,
  // Toggles on the selected style and aria-current attribute of the NavItem
  isSelected: boolean
}
```

By default the `isSelected` value if left undefined, will be evaluated by the condition `router.pathname === href`, pass in `isSelected` if you have a custom condition or would like more granular control over the selected state of Navigation items.

### Piecing it all together

The code snippet below shows how to use these three components in conjunction to create a custom Navigation component that:

a) Has the styling constraints of the default Admin-UI navigation

b) Renders out all the necessary routes generated from our Keystone `lists`

c) Adds a new custom route to take us to the `keystonejs docs`.

d) Renders out additional UI based on whether or not the user has signed in provided by the `authenticatedItem` prop.

```tsx
// admin/components/CustomNavigation.tsx
import { NavigationContainer, NavItem, ListNavItems } from '@keystone-next/keystone/admin-ui/components';
import type { NavigationProps } from '@keystone-next/keystone/admin-ui/components';

export function CustomNavigation({ authenticatedItem, routes }: NavigationProps) {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer authenticatedItem={authenticatedItem}>
      <NavItem href="/">Dashboard</NavItem>
      <ListNavItems lists={lists}/>
      <NavItem href="https://keystonejs.com/guides/custom-navigation-guide">
        Navigation Guide
      </NavItem>
    </NavigationContainer>
  )
}
```

!> **Note** When opting into a custom Navigation component you will need to specify a NavItem for the `Dashboard` page (the index route). Keysone doesn't provide this to you out of the box, as it's not strictly a list concern, but doing so is straight-forward as seen in the snippet above.

If you want a custom order to your list based NavItems or want to insert custom markup but would still prefer not to pass list properties to `NavItem` yourself, you can use the exported `ListNavItem` component as below:

```tsx
// admin/components/CustomNavigation.tsx
import { NavigationContainer, NavItem, ListNavItem } from '@keystone-next/keystone/admin-ui/components';
import type { NavigationProps } from '@keystone-next/keystone/admin-ui/components';

export function CustomNavigation({ authenticatedItem, routes }: NavigationProps) {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer authenticatedItem={authenticatedItem}>
      <NavItem href="/">Dashboard</NavItem>
      {lists.map(list => (
        <>
          {/* Some additional custom markup here */}
          <ListNavItem list={list} />
        </>
      ))}
      <NavItem href="https://keystonejs.com/guides/custom-navigation-guide">
        Navigation Guide
      </NavItem>
    </NavigationContainer>
  )
}

```

## Adding the custom navigation component to the Admin-UI

Keystone is made aware of custom components it needs to render in the Admin-UI via the `/admin/config.ts` file in your project root.
Below is the expected type for the component export:

```ts
export type AdminConfig = {
  components?: {
    Logo?: (props: {}) => ReactElement;
    Navigation?: (props: NavigationProps) => ReactElement;
  };
};
```

Reference your custom Navigation component in the export as so, the exported component can either be declared inline or imported from elsewhere in your project.

```ts
import { CustomNavigation } from './components/CustomNavigation';
export  const component: AdminConfig['components'] = {
    Navigation: CustomNavigation
}
```

Once this is done, you should see your custom navigation component in your Admin-UI Navigation
