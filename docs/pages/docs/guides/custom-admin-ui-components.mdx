# Custom Admin UI Pages

In this guide we'll show you how to add custom components to the Keystone Admin UI.

To import a custom component for rendering within the admin-ui, ensure that the `admin/config` file exists in the root of your Keystone Project.
This file expects a named export `components`. **Presently this `components` export only supports a custom Logo component**:

```tsx
// admin/config.tsx
import React from 'react';

function CustomLogo () {
    return <h3>Custom Logo here </h3>
}

export const components = {
    Logo: CustomLogo
}
```

If you have styling constraints, we recommend using the jsx export from the `@keystone-ui/core` package, as this will ensure that the version of emotion you're using conforms with the version of emotion used internally within Keystone.

```tsx
// admin/config.tsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from '@keystone-ui/core';

function CustomLogo () {
    return <h3 css={{
        background: 'papayawhip'
    }}>Custom Logo here </h3>
}

export const components = {
    Logo: CustomLogo
}
```

Note that doing so means you are no longer required to import React into your file.
Of course this is purely a recommendation, if you would prefer to roll your own css-in-js solution in with your custom component please feel free to! Although this may require additional configuration outside of the scope of this guide.

?> **Old JSX transform** As of the time of writing this guide, Keystone is internally still leveraging the old JSX transform, which means that any `.tsx` files within the admin folder will need to be preceded with a React import.

export default ({ children }) => <Markdown>{children}</Markdown>;
