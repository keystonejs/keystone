# Custom Admin UI Pages

In this guide we'll show you how to add custom pages to the Keystone Admin UI.
As the Keystone Admin UI is built on top of NextJS, it exposes the same pages directory for adding custom pages.

To create a custom page, ensure that the `admin/pages` directory exists in the root of your Keystone Project.
Much like with Next, all files in this directory will be added as routes to the Admin-UI.
The default export of every file in this directory is expected to be a valid React Component rendered out as the contents of the route.

```tsx
// admin/pages/MyCustomAdminUIPage
import React from 'react';
export default function () {
    return (
        <h1>This is a custom Admin UI Page</h1>
        <p>It can be accessed via the route '/MyCustomPage'</p>
    )
}
```

If you have styling constraints, we recommend using the jsx export from the `@keystone-ui/core` package, as this will ensure that the version of emotion you're using conforms with the version of emotion used internally within Keystone.

```tsx
// admin/config.tsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from '@keystone-ui/core';
export default function () {
    return (
        <h1 css={{
            fontSize: '3rem'
        }}>This is a custom Admin UI Page</h1>
        <p>It can be accessed via the route '/MyCustomPage'</p>
    )
}
```

Note that doing so means you are no longer required to import React into your file.
Of course this is purely a recommendation, if you would prefer to roll your own css-in-js solution in with your custom component please feel free to! Although this may require additional configuration outside of the scope of this guide.

?> **Not all NextJS exports are available:** As of the inception of this guide, Keystone **only** expects the page component as a default export in the pages directory. This means that unlike with Next, auxillary exports such as `getStaticProps` and `getServerProps` will be ignored.
?> **Navigation** As of the time of writing this guide, there is presently no way to

?> **Old JSX transform** As of the time of writing this guide, Keystone is internally still leveraging the old JSX transform, which means that any `.tsx` files within the admin folder will need to be preceded with a React import.
