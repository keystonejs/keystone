# Custom Admin UI Pages

In this guide we'll show you how to add custom pages to the Keystone Admin UI.
As the Keystone Admin UI is built on top of NextJS, it exposes the same pages directory for adding custom pages.

To create a custom page, ensure that the `admin/pages` directory exists in the root of your Keystone Project.
Much like with Next, all files in this directory will be added as routes to the Admin-UI.
The default export of every file in this directory is expected to be a valid React Component rendered out as the contents of the route.

```tsx
// admin/pages/MyCustomAdminUIPage
export default function () {
    return (
        <h1>This is a custom Admin UI Page</h1>
        <p>It can be accessed via the route '/MyCustomPage'</p>
    )
}
```

?> **Not all NextJS exports are available:** As of the inception of this guide, Keystone **only** expects the page component as a default export in the pages directory. This means that unlike with Next, auxillary exports such as `getStaticProps` and `getServerProps` will be ignored.

export default ({ children }) => <Markdown>{children}</Markdown>;
