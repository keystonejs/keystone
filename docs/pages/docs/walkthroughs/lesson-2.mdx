# Lesson 2: Creating relationships

Learn how to connect two content types to each another and configure how you make those connections in Admin UI.

## Where we left off

In the [first lesson](/docs/walkthroughs/lesson-1) we got our Keystone blog project up and running with a database and `user` list:

```js
// keystone.ts
import { list, config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists: {
    User: list({
      fields: {
        name: text({ validation: { isRequired: true } }),
        email: text({ validation: { isRequired: true }, isIndexed: 'unique' }),
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

We’re now going to create a post list type, and connect it to users with relationship fields.

## Make a Lists object

Before we define fields for a `post` type, let's pull lists out into its own object so it's easier to reason about going forward:

```js{4-11,18}
import { list, config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ validation: { isRequired: true } }),
      email: text({ validation: { isRequired: true }, isIndexed: 'unique' }),
    },
  }),
};

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists,
});
```

!> **Protip**: you could also move lists into its own file, and import it into `keystone.ts`

## Create a Post list

To create a post type we add a second `Post` key to the lists object. Let’s add another `text` field for the post’s `title` to begin with:

```js{11-15}[1-3,18-24]
import { list, config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ validation: { isRequired: true } }),
      email: text({ validation: { isRequired: true }, isIndexed: 'unique' }),
    },
  }),
  Post: list({
    fields: {
      title: text(),
    },
  }),
};

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists,
});
```

Let's check that this works. Boot up our Keystone app and have a look:

?> We’re skipping over the "content" field for the time being to keep this lesson focused on relationships. We’ll come back to it in [Lesson 5](/docs/walkthroughs/lesson-5).

## Connect Users with Posts

Now that we have two lists, let's make a relationship between them. When deciding how to relate lists it's helpful to consider:

- Should a user be able to create **one** or **many** posts?
- Should a post be attributable to **one** or **many** users?

Let’s say that a post can be associated with only one user, but a user can have many posts. To create this relationship, we will add a [relationship](/docs/guides/relationships) field to each list that defines their connection to one another:

```js{2,9,15}[19-30]
import { list, config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text, relationship } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ validation: { isRequired: true } }),
      email: text({ validation: { isRequired: true }, isIndexed: 'unique' }),
      posts: relationship({ ref: 'Post.author', many: true }),
    },
  }),
  Post: list({
    fields: {
      title: text(),
      author: relationship({ ref: 'User.posts' }),
    },
  }),
};

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists,
});
```

The `relationship` references the name for the `field` of the list it is relating to make it [two-sided](/docs/guides/relationships#two-sided), so the
`author` field relates to `User.posts`, while the `posts` field relates to `User.author`.

!> Naming relationships can be important if lists have multiple relationships. If, for example, we wanted to let users also 'like' posts, we could add a second differently named relationship field between `User` and `Post` called 'likes'.

Let's open the Admin UI and create a post:

![Admin UI showing creation of a nerw post, and relationship to a user from the post ](https://keystonejs.s3.amazonaws.com/framework-assets/assets/walkthroughs/lesson-2/my-first-relationship.gif)

## Configure a field’s appearance

In our current schema, the `author` field provides a `select` input to connect a user to the post. This is the default `displayMode` for this field type.

In Keystone it's possible to change that display to suit your needs. This is achieved with a field's `ui` option. Each field comes with different `ui` options that you can explore. for the `author` field we’ll make a few changes to improve the editing experience for Admin UI users:

```js{18-24}[2-12,28-35]
//keystone.ts
import { list, config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text, relationship } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ validation: { isRequired: true } }),
      email: text({ validation: { isRequired: true }, isIndexed: 'unique' }),
      posts: relationship({ ref: 'Post.author', many: true }),
    },
  }),
  Post: list({
    fields: {
      title: text(),
      author: relationship({
        ref: 'User.posts',
        ui: {
          displayMode: 'cards',
          cardFields: ['name', 'email'],
          inlineEdit: { fields: ['name', 'email'] },
          linkToItem: true,
          inlineCreate: { fields: ['name', 'email'] },
        },
      }),
    },
  }),
};
export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists,
});
```

We've made a few changes here, so let's break them down:

- The `displayMode` of the relationship is shown as `cards`
- We've made sure that the card links to fields in the `user` list with `linkToItem`
- We made the user attributes of `name` and `email` editable inline with `inlineEdit`

With a dash of extra config we’ve created a very different editing experience where user data can be altered directly in the post form:

![Admin UI showing create screen for a blog post](https://keystonejs.s3.amazonaws.com/framework-assets/assets/walkthroughs/lesson-2/relationship-edit-cards-display.gif)

## What we have now

Our app has a new `post` list with a title and a link to `users` via the `author` field that you can edit inline with the `cards` UI display mode. Admin UI editors can also create posts from the `user` form with a two-way relationship.

```ts
// keystone.ts
import { list, config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text, relationship } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ validation: { isRequired: true } }),
      email: text({ validation: { isRequired: true }, isIndexed: 'unique' }),
      posts: relationship({ ref: 'Post.author', many: true }),
    },
  }),
  Post: list({
    fields: {
      title: text(),
      author: relationship({
        ref: 'User.posts',
        ui: {
          displayMode: 'cards',
          cardFields: ['name', 'email'],
          inlineEdit: { fields: ['name', 'email'] },
          linkToItem: true,
          inlineCreate: { fields: ['name', 'email'] },
        },
      }),
    },
  }),
};

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists,
});
```
