# Modes

With the support of SQLite in Keystone Next, you can now choose to use Keystone in a “standalone” (headless) fashion, or “embed” your backend within a frontend app.

We refer to these two use cases as “modes”. **Embedded mode is new**, and brings a different approach to integrating Keystone. It offers some quick wins (for developers in particular), but it also comes with restrictions that constrain it to a narrow set of uses at this point in time.

!> Modes is conceptual framework. It has no dedicated APIs, and there are no mentions of modes in the API docs.

## Standalone mode

Standalone mode is the default (headless) way to use Keystone. In fact, **from version 5 and lower, standalone mode was the only way you could use Keystone**. The premise of standalone mode is:

- Keystone operates completely independently of any frontend.
- Editors read and write to your database, via Admin UI, over the internet.

?> Unless explicitly stated, all Keystone functionality works in standalone mode, and all documentation assumes you’re using this mode.

!> Standalone mode doesn’t restrict you from co-locating your Keystone files in the same repo as your frontend. It’s just not important where your frontend(s) are.

## Embedded mode

_Embedded_ mode is made possible by the support of SQLite in this latest version of Keystone. SQLite gives you the option to store your files and database content _within_ your local Keystone repo – instead of an external host. This local storage capability makes it possible to embed Keystone within a frontend application, _and_ build from its APIs at runtime.

### Disadvantages

- Because Admin UI access is restricted to a local development runtime – this mode is (currently) **not suitable when you need more than one editor**.
- SQLite doesn’t support scalability, concurrency, and centralization as well as PostgreSQL. **If your project has scaling needs, you’re probably better off with standalone mode and external PostgreSQL hosting**.

### Advantages

- An easy way to prototype schema without configuring external databases (all [example starters](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/examples) use SQLite).
- File and DB storage can be version controlled.
- An easy way to power a Next.js frontend app.
- Frontend and backend can be deployed to Vercel as a monorepo.
- With write access restricted to local development, it’s more secure.

!> Embedded mode is a great way to operate a personal Next.js blog or portfolio with a CMS for content editing, instead of MDX.

### How to implement embedded mode

?> Currently, the only way to run embedded mode is within a Next.js app.

Add the following dependencies to your project:

```bash
yarn add @keystone-next/keystone @keystone-next/admin-ui @keystone-next/fields
```

Add the `withKeystone` constant to `next.config.js`. This will let the Next.js frontend encapsulate Keystone in its script runtime.

!> Even though the frontend app calls Keystone at runtime, Keystone still operates independently of the Next.js frontend.

```js
// next.config.js

const { withKeystone } = require('@keystone-next/keystone/next');

module.exports = withKeystone();
```
