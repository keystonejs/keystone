# Hooks API

Hooks give solution developers a way to add custom logic to the framework of lists, fields and operations Keystone provides.

This document describes:

- How and where to configure hooks of different types
- The specific arguments and usage information of different hook sets

For a more general overview of the concepts, patterns and function of the Keystone hook system, see the
[hooks guide](/docs/guides/hooks.md).

Note: For performance reasons relationship fields are not fully resolved by hooks, and will return an array of ids. To fetch data from a relationship field, a second query is required. To do this inside a hook function use the `context.executeGraphQL()` method.

## Hook types

Hooks can be categorised into four [types](/docs/guides/hooks.md#hook-type)
depending on where in the list schema they're attached:

- [List hooks](#list-hooks)
- [Field hooks](#field-hooks)
- [Field type hooks](#field-type-hooks)
- [Authentication hooks](#authentication-hooks)

With the exception of the authentication hooks, the [hook sets](/docs/guides/hooks.md#hook-set) that span these types have very similar signatures.
Any differences are called out in the documentation below.

### List hooks

List hooks can be defined by the system developer by specifying the `hooks` attribute of a list configuration when calling `createList()`.
Hooks for the `create`, `update` and `delete` operations are available.

#### Usage

```js
keystone.createList('User', {
  fields: {
    name: { type: Text },
  },
  hooks: {
    // Hooks for create and update operations
    resolveInput: async (...) => {...},
    validateInput: async (...) => {...},
    beforeChange: async (...) => {...},
    afterChange: async (...) => {...},

    // Hooks for delete operations
    validateDelete: async (...) => {...},
    beforeDelete: async (...) => {...},
    afterDelete: async (...) => {...},
  },
});
```

### Field hooks

Field hooks can be defined by the system developer by specifying the `hooks` attribute of a field configuration when calling `createList()`.
Hooks for the `create`, `update` and `delete` operations are available.

#### Usage

```js
keystone.createList('User', {
  fields: {
    name: {
      type: Text,
      hooks: {
        // Hooks for create and update operations
        resolveInput: async (...) => {...}
        validateInput: async (...) => {...}
        beforeChange: async (...) => {...}
        afterChange: async (...) => {...}

        // Hooks for delete operations
        validateDelete: async (...) => {...}
        beforeDelete: async (...) => {...}
        afterDelete: async (...) => {...}
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Field type hooks

Field type hooks are associated with a particular _field type_ and are applied to all fields of that type.
Custom field types can implement hooks by implementing the following hook methods on the `Field` base class.
See the [Custom Field Types guide](/docs/guides/custom-field-types.md) for more info.

Hooks for the `create`, `update` and `delete` operations are available.

#### Usage

```js
class CustomFieldType extends Field {
  // Hooks for create and update operations
  async resolveInput(...) {...},
  async validateInput(...) {...},
  async beforeChange(...) {...},
  async afterChange(...) {...},

  // Hooks for delete operations
  async beforeDelete(...) {...},
  async validateDelete(...) {...},
  async afterDelete(...) {...},
}
```

### Authentication hooks

Authentication hooks can be defined by the system developer by specifying the `hooks` attribute when calling `createAuthStrategy()`.
Hooks for the `authenticate` and `unauthenticate` operations are available.

#### Usage

```js
keystone.createAuthStrategy({
  type: PasswordAuthStrategy,
  list: 'User',
  hooks: {
    resolveAuthInput: async (...) => {...},
    validateAuthInput: async (...) => {...},
    beforeAuth: async (...) => {...},
    afterAuth: async (...) => {...},

    beforeUnauth: async (...) => {...},
    afterUnauth: async (...) => {...},
  },
});
```

## Hook sets

### `resolveInput`

**Used to modify the `resolvedData`.**

- Invoked after access control and field defaults are applied
- Available for `create` and `update` operations

The return of `resolveInput` can be a `Promise` or an `Object`.
It should resolve to the same structure as the `resolvedData`.
The result is passed to [the next function in the execution order](/docs/guides/hooks.md#execution-order).

Return values are ignored.

};
```

### `afterChange`

**Used to cause side effects after the primary operation is executed.**

- Invoked after the primary operation has completed
- Available for `create` and `update` operations

`afterChange` hooks perform actions after data is saved.
It receives both the "pre-update" item that was stored (`existingItem`) and the resultant, "post-update" item data (`updatedItem`).
This includes any DB-level defaults.
Notably, for `create` operations, this includes the item's `id`.

Return values are ignored.

### Running GraphQL Queries From Hook

If you need to execute a GraphQL query from within your hook function you can use `context.executeGraphQL()`.
See the docs on [server-side graphql operations](/docs/discussions/server-side-graphql.md) for more details.
