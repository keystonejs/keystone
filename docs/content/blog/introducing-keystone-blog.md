We're happy to introduce the **Keystone Blog**, brought to you by the Keystone team.

Our _Updates_ page is going away and we are not one to let good content slip away. So some of the useful and important content in _Updates_ have been repurposed into blog posts. Woot!

Here are few interesting tidbits that you might notice with the launch of Keystone Blog:

- Sparkly new header layout. âœ¨

- _Updates_ page has been replaced with the blog with some of its content ported over.

- Blog page has a nice _Table of contents_ section to help quickly scan and navigate between the headings.

Stay tuned for more blog posts!

If you like using Keystone, we'd appreciate a shout out in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KeystoneJS) and a star in [GitHub](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone).
