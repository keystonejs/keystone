We have added learning series to quickly get started and learn how to work with Keystone. The series has step by step tutorials introducing the key concepts and shows you how to get up and running with Keystone. 

At the end of the series you'll have learnt how these core concepts work in Keystone by building a **fully functioning backend for a blog**.
- auth
- relationships
- passwords
- sessions 
- GraphQL API work in Keystone 

Check out our [Keystone Learning series](/docs/walkthroughs).
