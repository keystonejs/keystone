## Custom Admin UI Navigation 🚏

You can now create your own custom navigation component with custom routes to be rendered in the Admin UI.

Check out our detailed [Custom Admin UI Navigation guide](https://keystonejs.com/docs/guides/custom-admin-ui-navigation) for all the details!

## Custom Admin UI Pages 📃

Take things a step further with custom pages. As the Admin UI is built on top of Next.js, it exposes the same `/pages` directory for adding custom pages.

ℹ️ In the near future you'll be able to directly embed pages within the
Keystone Admin UI itself, stay tuned!

Read our new [Custom Admin UI Pages guide](https://keystonejs.com/docs/guides/custom-admin-ui-pages) for more details.

## Custom Admin UI Logo 🚩

Wait, there's more. You can also replace the default Admin UI logo with your own brand assets. ✨
