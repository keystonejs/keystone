Learn how to install Keystone, create your first content type, and get an app up and running with an intuitive editing environment.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Keystone getting started series!

Together weâ€™ll learn how to turn an empty folder into a database-backed Keystone instance with related content types, publishing workflows, password protection, an editing interface, and more.

This series assumes you have some basic familiarity with:

- The **command line** for running Keystone
- The **node ecosystem** for installing packages from npm, and running npm scripts
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** for programming Keystone. You won't need to use much typescript in this series, however you can still benefit from using Keystone's inbuilt types
- **GraphQL** for querying your Keystone content

## Install Keystone

Letâ€™s start by setting up a workspace for a new Keystone project. Make a new folder and initialise it:

```bash
mkdir keystone-learning
cd keystone-learning
npm init
```

{% hint kind="tip" %}
Weâ€™ll be using `npm` for installing packages, but you can use any other package manager you prefer.
{% /hint %}

Now add the Keystone package:

```bash
npm install @keystone-6/core
```

## Configure Keystone

Keystone looks for a file named `keystone.ts` (or `keystone.js`) at the project root to handle configuration needs. Let's go ahead and set one up using TypeScript:

```js
// keystone.ts
export default {};
```

And add TypeScript as a dependency:

```bash
npm install typescript
```

{% hint kind="tip" %}
If youâ€™d rather use JavaScript, make a `keystone.js` file and skip the TypeScript installation step above.
{% /hint %}

Your folder structure should now look like this:

```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules        # Dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ keystone.ts         # Keystone config
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # With Keystone and TypeScript as dependencies
â””â”€â”€ package-lock.json   # Your npm lock file
```

We now need to configure `keystone.ts` with two parts to get our project running:

- [`db`](/docs/config/config#db) to define a database configuration
- [`list`](/docs/config/lists) to define the shape of the information we put in that database

### Add a Database

Weâ€™ll use [SQLite](/docs/config/config#sqlite) in this project to keep things simple, but you can also use [Postgres](/docs/config/config#postgresql). The minimum config for SQLite looks like this:

```ts
import { config } from '@keystone-6/core';

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists: {} // ...
});
```

This will use the local path `./keystone.db` for your database storage.

{% hint kind="tip" %}
Keystone uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to take care of database admin including [migrations](/docs/guides/cli#working-with-migrations). Keystone owns the Prisma workflow so you can focus on building apps instead of DB admin chores.
{% /hint %}

### Create your first List

Now that we have a database configured, letâ€™s connect some content to it!

Weâ€™re going to build a simple blog with **users** and **posts**. Letâ€™s start with the `User` list using [`text`](/docs/fields/text) fields for their `name` and `email`:

```js{2,9-15}[5-8]
import { config, list } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { allowAll } from '@keystone-6/core/access';
import { text } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists: {
    User: list({
      access: allowAll,
      fields: {
        name: text({ validation: { isRequired: true } }),
        email: text({ validation: { isRequired: true }, isIndexed: 'unique' }),
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

**List** names are derived from the keys in the `lists` object.
For example, the `User` key becomes the name for the respective `User` list.
This key will be used in Admin UI for the listâ€™s default display name, and in Keystoneâ€™s auto-generated GraphQL API.

**Field** names are derived from the keys in the [`fields`](/docs/fields/overview) object.
Like lists, theyâ€™ll be used in Admin UI for field label defaults, and in the GraphQL API. We've added validation to both our fields to say that they
are required, and declared that emails must be unique, so there can only be one user with each email.

{% hint kind="tip" %}
**Admin UI** is the name of Keystoneâ€™s user friendly editing environment. Accessible from a browser, itâ€™s the place where weâ€™ll add and update content that will be stored in the database.
{% /hint %}

## Run Keystone

We now have everything we need to start Keystone, so letâ€™s do just that:

```bash
npx keystone dev
```

In a few seconds your terminal will provide you with you a link to the Keystone Admin UI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Head on over to [http://localhost:3000/users](http://localhost:3000/users) where you can create your first user with a `name` and `email`:

**Hurrah! You now have Keystone up and running** {% emoji symbol="ðŸŽ‰" alt="Party Popper" /%}

Next up, weâ€™ll level-up our blog starter with a `post` list and connect it to our users.
