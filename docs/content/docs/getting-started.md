[`create-keystone-app`](https://github.com/keystonejs/create-keystone-app) is a CLI app that makes it easier for you to initiate a Keystone project.
It generates some files for you and installs all the dependencies you need to run the Admin UI and start using the [GraphQL API](/docs/graphql/overview).

## Quick Start

```sh
npm create keystone-app@latest
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Installing a Keystone instance

Open your preferred shell and make sure you’re in the folder you want to create your new project in.
`create-keystone-app` will generate a new folder with your new Keystone files in it.

### npm

```sh
npm create keystone-app@latest
```
### npx

Use npm's [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx):

```sh
npx create-keystone-app@latest
```

## Naming your app

The CLI will ask you to name your app. Once named, it will create a new SQLite database.

{% hint kind="warn" %}
You can switch to another database such as PostgreSQL once your project is created, check out the docs on [Database Setup](https://keystonejs.com/docs/config/config#db).
{% /hint %}

## Opening your shiny new Admin UI

You can now `cd` into the folder that was created for you and start Keystone:

```sh
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will generate the Admin UI pages via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) on <http://localhost:3000>. When you visit the Admin UI for the first time you will be presented with a handy screen that asks you to create a user:

![The welcome screen giving you the ability the create a new user to log into the Admin UI](/assets/getting-started/welcome-screen.png)

Go ahead and create your first user. The email address and password will be used to login to Keystone’s Admin UI. Once you've created your user, you’ll be logged in to a new Keystone Admin UI that comes with two [lists](/docs/config/config#lists).
From here you can explore and interact with the data in your system, and understand how Keystone’s schema relates to your GraphQL API which you can explore at <http://localhost:3000/api/graphql>.

## Output

Keytone creates the following files in your newly generated folder. The most important ones are [`keystone.ts`](/docs/config/config) and [`schema.ts`](/docs/config/lists).

```sh
.
├── auth.ts            # Authentication configuration for Keystone
├── keystone.ts        # The main entry file for configuring Keystone
├── node_modules       # Your dependencies
├── package.json       # Your package.json with four scripts prepared for you
├── package-lock.json  # Your npm lock file
├── README.md          # Additional info to help you get started
├── schema.graphql     # GraphQL schema (automatically generated by Keystone)
├── schema.prisma      # Prisma configuration (automatically generated by Keystone)
├── schema.ts          # Where you design your data schema
└── tsconfig.json      # Your typescript config
```

## Scripts

`package.json` includes the following npm scripts you can run locally:

- [`dev`](/docs/guides/cli#dev) runs Keystone in **development** mode at <http://localhost:3000>.
- [`start`](/docs/guides/cli#start) runs Keystone in **production** mode.
- [`build`](/docs/guides/cli#build) will build the project and is required to be run before `start`.
- [`postinstall`](/docs/guides/cli#postinstall) ensures files that Keystone generates exist and are kept up to date.

## Where to next?

- Customise Keystone with the [System Configuration API](./config/config).
- Add fields and relationships using [Lists API](/docs/config/lists).
- Use a different database with the [Config API](/docs/config/config#db).
